1
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,727
We found gold, boys!

2
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,469
Lucky seven.

3
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:14,304
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

4
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,306
Oh, this is it. Uh-huh.

5
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:17,440
I have the number.

6
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:19,176
- I have the number.
- Yeah.

7
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,777
Who do you think is gonna get
a turn with her tonight, boys?

8
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,079
- Yeah, come on!
- Number one?

9
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:25,348
Never been number one before.
Number one!

10
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,951
Yeah, boys!
Winning number, I got 15!

11
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:31,854
It's gonna win!

12
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,856
Fun tonight, boys.

13
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:35,492
- Hey. Give it back!
- No, no, no.

14
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:36,993
That's the winning ticket!

15
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:39,962
Oh, Angel.

16
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:43,300
- Angel.
- My Angel!

17
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,434
Angel!

18
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,051
All right, all right!

19
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,520
Vagabonds,

20
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:05,222
show me your tickets!

21
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:08,791
One more charmed man,

22
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:10,260
then she's done shagging
for the day.

23
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,262
She's all worn out!

24
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:16,366
I have plenty of other girls!

25
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,235
Chinese, African, Spanish.

26
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:20,403
Dealer's choice.

27
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:22,205
But if you want Angel...

28
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:26,276
...you'll have to
come back tomorrow.

29
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:29,346
And by guess or by golly,
it could be your lucky day.

30
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:32,282
I have the lucky number!

31
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:34,783
Forty-one!

32
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,220
Yeah!

33
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:40,789
Get off me!

34
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,955
Sarah!

35
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:14,424
I'm down here.

36
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:17,460
Child, your mama wants to know
if you got the flowers.

37
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:18,461
Is he here?

38
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:19,895
He'll be here soon.

39
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,897
You must hurry.

40
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,899
I'll pick more now.

41
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,507
Thank you for getting these.

42
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,442
You know how much
I love flowers.

43
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,110
I do.

44
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:38,181
Now, blue is
his favorite color.

45
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:40,450
<i>Remember to stand straight up</i>

46
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,218
<i>and act like a lady.</i>

47
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:56,366
Sarah?

48
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:13,416
Isn't she beautiful, Alex?

49
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,053
Did you pick blue
on purpose, Mae?

50
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,023
Because it brings out
the color in her eyes?

51
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,095
- Cleo!
- She's not here.

52
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:27,464
I sent her to town.

53
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:30,567
Well, that leaves us in a fix.

54
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,268
Doesn't it?

55
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:40,410
- Papa...
- Don't call me that.

56
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:46,116
Uh, I-I wanted to thank you
for the gifts you send me.

57
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:48,251
- Hush, Sarah.
- What gifts?

58
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,153
Tell me.

59
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,423
I like the candies you send me.

60
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:58,061
The best of all
is the crystal swan.

61
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:01,264
Indeed.

62
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:04,467
I'm so pleased to know
how much my gifts mean.

63
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,003
Darling,
go outside and play now.

64
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:09,406
Find Cleo when she returns.

65
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,007
Can't I stay?

66
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,076
I want you to go outside
to play.

67
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:15,211
I want to talk
with your mother alone.

68
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:17,280
Can I come back
once you're done talking?

69
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:20,116
Your mother will come get you
when she's ready.

70
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,153
Now, run along.

71
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:25,388
As you've been told.

72
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:29,292
I brought back that swan
from Europe for you,

73
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,428
and you throw it away
on a child.

74
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:32,695
She is your daughter.

75
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:34,631
I have enough children
by my wife.

76
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:35,999
Legitimate children.

77
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,367
Do you know what it's like

78
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,035
for me to walk down the streets
in this town?

79
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:40,336
I gave up everything for you.

80
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,038
She should never
have existed, Mae.

81
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:43,606
I sent you to a doctor
to get rid of that mess!

82
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,974
You son of a bitch.

83
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,378
You ungrateful bitch!

84
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:58,521
<i>Where have you been, darling?</i>

85
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,490
<i>I've been looking
all over for you.</i>

86
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,227
Is he coming back?

87
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,697
Maybe not for a long time.

88
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,199
Maybe not ever.

89
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:11,434
I don't want him to.

90
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,238
We'll have to wait and see.

91
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:21,377
You father is a very busy
and important man.

92
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:29,986
What if I got sick and died?

93
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,655
You're not gonna
get sick and die.

94
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:34,757
You're far too young
and healthy for that.

95
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,392
But, Mama...

96
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,530
...if I did, would he come back
and stay with you?

97
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:41,598
No.

98
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:45,235
Don't you ever ask
that question ever again.

99
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:46,503
- Do you understand?
- But...

100
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:48,404
Never again.

101
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:52,041
None of this has anything
to do with you.

102
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:58,715
I love you more than
anything or anyone

103
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:01,518
<i>in this whole wide world.</i>

104
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:03,052
Angel?

105
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:04,787
Angel!

106
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:08,224
It's break time.

107
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:12,161
My mother ran off
when I was five.

108
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:13,663
And my aunt took me in.

109
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,732
Auntie Priscilla.

110
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:20,336
She used a switch on me
at least twice a day. Look.

111
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,439
The bitch with a switch.

112
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:26,175
She was the meanest woman
I ever knew...

113
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:27,410
meaner than the Duchess.

114
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,546
She would make me cut
a fresh switch

115
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,814
from the tree in the front yard
every day.

116
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:35,285
So, one day,

117
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:39,322
she was out having tea
with her phony friends.

118
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:42,325
So I took an ax,
and I chopped the tree down.

119
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:46,429
It went through the house,
crushing her fancy-ass parlor.

120
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:51,534
Yeah.

121
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:53,369
God, I just wish
I had've stuck around

122
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:56,339
to see the look on Priss's face
when she got home.

123
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:02,312
And sometimes I wish

124
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,113
that I could go back
and say that I'm sorry.

125
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:05,782
Maybe my life
might've been different.

126
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,216
How so?

127
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,453
Well, might not
have ended up here,

128
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,788
you know...

129
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:16,326
...just being a mattress hole
for whoremongers.

130
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,361
Just collecting gold dust
that isn't mine.

131
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:24,500
My father sold me
for three ounces of gold.

132
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:29,372
And he told me that I was
going to stay in a palace.

133
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,476
I thought he meant
a royal palace.

134
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,777
Like a princess.

135
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:40,249
It's bad.

136
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,151
- Angel.
- Hmm?

137
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:44,187
You got any big plans?

138
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,688
- Plans?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:47,457
You got to have plans, Angel.

140
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,759
You got to hope for something
more in this world

141
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:52,629
outside of this... paradise.

142
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:54,330
Hope for what?

143
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,733
You can't get by without hope.

144
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:58,468
I get by.

145
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,535
How?

146
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:02,538
Never look back,
never look forward.

147
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:09,646
Come on.

148
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,481
Come on.

149
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:14,951
Come on.

150
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:17,520
Come on.

151
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,925
Come on.

152
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:59,362
Come on, boy.

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,667
Great job.

154
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:06,335
Come on.

155
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,510
<i>Lord,</i>

156
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:18,247
thank you for blessing the land
that you have given me.

157
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:22,385
May I always know,

158
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:27,390
as I tend to each crop
and creature,

159
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:29,792
you're the one
that helps them grow.

160
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:34,764
Grant me strength and wisdom.

161
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:39,368
Please protect the farm
from harm.

162
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,771
And thank you, Lord.

163
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:44,474
Amen.

164
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,315
Lord, I was, uh...

165
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,617
I was hoping that...

166
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,420
maybe you might give me a...

167
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:59,722
I mean, provide me...

168
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,495
...with someone
I can share this with.

169
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,965
Some guidance.

170
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,666
A sign.

171
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,836
Anything.

172
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,876
Maybe she likes fishing.

173
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:24,313
You know,
maybe she has long legs.

174
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:26,849
Anyway, you...

175
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:29,285
you know the kind I need.

176
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:32,421
I trust you.

177
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:11,861
What?

178
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:15,832
Walk on.

179
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,735
There she is.

180
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,572
Ma'am.

181
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:26,776
Ma'am.

182
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:29,846
Look at that!

183
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,681
Hey, back up.

184
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,550
Stand back.

185
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,889
She's something to see,
ain't she?

186
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:43,392
Who is she?

187
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:44,660
That's Angel.

188
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:47,130
Finest girl
west of the Rockies.

189
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:49,465
Every Monday and Friday
afternoon,

190
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:50,733
she takes walks.

191
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,602
They all come out to watch her.

192
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:54,470
I can see why
her husband is armed.

193
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:55,972
Oh, that ain't her husband.

194
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,473
Bodyguard.

195
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:59,609
No one gets within
a foot of her for free.

196
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:01,744
I have to meet her.

197
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,579
You'll have to get in line.

198
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:05,748
The Duchess holds
a daily lottery

199
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,051
to see who gets to spend
quality time with her.

200
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:09,485
A duchess?

201
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,888
She owns the brothel up there.

202
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:13,890
Palace.

203
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,491
Hey, what,
sh-she's a prostitute?

204
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:16,926
Uh-huh.

205
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,528
Lord, you most certainly have
a sense of humor.

206
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,498
That's the girl?

207
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:23,833
What's that?

208
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:25,801
Uh-uh-uh, nothing.

209
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:30,506
- Been on that farm too long.
- Yeah, let's settle up.

210
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,976
Come on. Take it in the back.

211
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,526
Whoa.

212
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:05,908
<i>I'm gonna tell you God's truth.</i>

213
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:13,116
All men want to do is use you.

214
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,817
<i>Your papa only</i>

215
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,819
<i>cared about
what your mama gave him.</i>

216
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:21,058
<i>And she gave him
everything she had.</i>

217
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:27,463
<i>And now he kicks her out
and cuts her off.</i>

218
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:31,567
<i>When you give them your heart,</i>

219
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,137
<i>they tear it to shreds.</i>

220
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,808
<i>None of them care.</i>

221
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:44,880
These stones are
green glass, not emeralds.

222
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,817
You got anything else?

223
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:50,053
No.

224
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:52,588
<i>Nobody cares about anybody</i>

225
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:53,723
<i>in this world.</i>

226
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,025
There is another way.

227
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:58,627
Just you and, uh...

228
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,863
five easy dollars.

229
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:25,155
Let's hop on one of those ships
and sail away.

230
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:29,292
Where would we go?

231
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:31,794
Far...

232
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,963
far away from here.

233
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:35,698
Mm.

234
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,734
Far away.

235
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:41,771
That sounds nice.

236
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:45,608
Mae!

237
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:47,110
You got company.

238
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:54,884
Why don't you think about
where we would go, hmm?

239
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,724
Come on, now.
We don't have all day.

240
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:29,718
Say my... my prayers
with me, baby.

241
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:36,859
Our Father, who art in heaven,

242
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:39,996
hallowed be thy name.

243
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,032
Thy kingdom come,

244
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:47,070
thy will be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

245
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:50,207
Give us this day
our daily bread...

246
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:54,177
...and...

247
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:57,047
...and...

248
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:03,019
Mama.

249
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:05,921
Mama, wake up, please.

250
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:07,723
Wake up.

251
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:40,257
<i>That is God's truth.</i>

252
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,893
Best you know that now, child.

253
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:49,698
I paid! Let me in!

254
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,834
Go to hell.

255
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,138
Come on! Angel!

256
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:57,474
Go to hell!

257
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:03,213
I said go away.

258
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,185
Fill the tub.

259
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,367
You hiding something from me?

260
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:25,968
Huh?

261
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:28,338
Think you're so special?

262
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:34,177
Better than me
and everyone else around here?

263
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:43,286
I know you're hiding something.

264
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,724
Duchess said
I'm off-limits to you.

265
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:51,827
You pig.

266
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,396
Let's go!

267
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,232
Put me down!

268
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,267
Put me down! Duchess!

269
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,373
No, no, uh-uh-uh.

270
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:04,907
Stay down! Huh?

271
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,477
- Enough?
- Enough.

272
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,877
Huh?

273
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,482
Come on, fight me! Come on!

274
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:17,254
You have no idea how much pain
I'm gonna wreak on you.

275
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:19,556
- Do it. Do it!
- Stop!

276
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:22,092
She needs to be
taught a lesson.

277
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:29,132
I heard her screams
from the hall.

278
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,370
Men knew what you were
doing to her, they'd hang you.

279
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:36,772
I have extra rope
if they're short.

280
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:40,843
Not another word.

281
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,313
Sober her up and talk to her.

282
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:45,248
- You understand?
- Yeah.

283
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,550
Coffee and bread
are on their way up.

284
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,185
Make sure she takes it in.

285
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:51,521
I need her ready to work
in two hours.

286
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:54,291
Not a mark on her.

287
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:55,958
Not a mark.

288
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,212
It's open.

289
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,193
What's your pleasure, mister?

290
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:38,068
Doesn't matter in here
if you're married.

291
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:41,204
Doesn't matter if your...

292
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:44,074
Christian mama doesn't approve.

293
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:48,311
There's no guilt in here, okay?

294
00:22:49,112 --> 00:22:52,982
Just pleasure. So don't be shy.
Tell me what you want.

295
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:56,919
You.

296
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:59,322
I'm all yours.

297
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:06,996
Why don't you come over here
and I'll wash you.

298
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,336
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise.

299
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:16,406
That won't be necessary, ma'am.

300
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,441
"Ma'am"?

301
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:20,043
Do I look like your mama?

302
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:21,877
No, ma'am.

303
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,114
No.

304
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,417
You do not.

305
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:32,322
The truth is, I...

306
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:34,691
I didn't come here for... that.

307
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,326
Yeah?

308
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,894
I just came here
to talk to you.

309
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,167
You want to talk?

310
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:48,471
There's a nice barkeep
named Murphy downstairs.

311
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:50,673
He'll talk your ear off.

312
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:11,194
Y-You-you... you live
in this room?

313
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:12,162
No.

314
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,497
My little white house
surrounded by roses

315
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,534
on top of the hill
is where I prefer to stay.

316
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:21,037
I shouldn't have come this way.

317
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,007
What other way is there?

318
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:26,976
Uh, I ain't sure.

319
00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:33,049
How old are you?

320
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:36,486
I'm real old. How old are you?

321
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,254
T-Twenty-six.

322
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:41,090
Ancient for a gold miner.

323
00:24:41,124 --> 00:24:44,561
Oh, s... no, no, see.
I-I ain't a miner.

324
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,463
I-I work on a farm.

325
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:54,204
Angel your real name?

326
00:24:54,237 --> 00:24:57,140
You can call me
whatever you want.

327
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,076
Well, my name is...

328
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:02,312
I don't want to know your name.

329
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:05,315
Michael Hosea.

330
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,284
Are you afraid of
what your wife might think

331
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:10,153
if you have your way with me?

332
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:12,155
Wife.

333
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:14,023
No, see, 'cause, uh...

334
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:16,626
I'm not married.

335
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:19,729
But I will be soon.

336
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:22,632
Then come over here and get
your last taste of freedom

337
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:24,501
while you can.

338
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:27,637
Oh, no, I can't, you see,
'cause I'm...

339
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,073
- gonna marry you.
- Mm.

340
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:32,175
You're gonna marry me?

341
00:25:33,076 --> 00:25:35,745
Take me away from here,
give me the life I deserve?

342
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:38,014
Mm-hmm.

343
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:42,652
You're my fifth proposal
this week.

344
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:47,290
How about we do what's on
your mind and we call it a day?

345
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:51,094
I'm gonna give you a good life.

346
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:55,431
Come on. Come away with me.

347
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:06,809
Time's up.

348
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,545
Come on.

349
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:12,782
I'm coming back.

350
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:16,553
All-all I ask for is-is-is
one honest half hour.

351
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:19,155
Five minutes with me,
you'd run like the devil.

352
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:20,523
Angel, Angel...

353
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:28,831
Next time I pray to God
for a woman to share my life,

354
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:33,303
I'm gonna be
a lot more specific.

355
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:34,671
<i>So you won</i>

356
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:37,273
the lottery again?

357
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:39,642
I paid double again.

358
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:43,112
Lucky me.

359
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:47,317
I do hate to see you just waste
your time and gold dust

360
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,686
just... just chatting.

361
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:53,323
Do you want to stay here
for the rest of your life?

362
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:55,558
I don't think that's really
any of your business.

363
00:26:55,592 --> 00:26:58,528
It was my business the minute
I saw you on the street.

364
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:00,463
Yeah, love at first sight,
right?

365
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:02,098
Right.

366
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:06,536
Oh, sorry. What, am I
putting you to sleep now?

367
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:10,173
All this talking is exhausting
to be honest.

368
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,575
So you'd rather
I join you on the bed?

369
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,510
At least you would've
left having gotten something

370
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:17,213
for your gold dust.

371
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,654
Let me get you
out of this place.

372
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:28,257
I'm serious.

373
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:34,631
Marry me.

374
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:39,335
Time's up.

375
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:42,472
Get your boots on. It's...

376
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,345
It's time for you to go.

377
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,282
Nice talking to you.

378
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:58,921
She said no, again.

379
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:00,423
Shocking.

380
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:01,691
I don't know.

381
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:05,194
Got enough gold dust
for one more try.

382
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:06,629
Maybe you need a new plan.

383
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:08,264
Buy some cattle.

384
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:10,266
It might've been cheaper.

385
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,968
Go home, Michael.

386
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:13,670
Work your farm.

387
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:17,507
Ain't no woman worth
that amount of gold.

388
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:20,677
Mm.

389
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,713
Angel, who's the man
you were with last night?

390
00:28:23,746 --> 00:28:24,714
Which one?

391
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:26,516
The good-looking one.

392
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:29,452
All look the same to me.

393
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:33,823
Six feet, dark hair, blue eyes.

394
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:35,692
When he smiled at me,

395
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:37,660
I could feel it
all the way down to my toes.

396
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:40,296
A pot-marked midget from
Nantucket could smile at you,

397
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,331
and you'd feel it
all the way down to your toes.

398
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:43,633
Drink your brandy, Lucky.

399
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,501
No one was talking to you.

400
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:47,570
I've had one untried boy
after another.

401
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:49,605
I would like to give
a real man a go.

402
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:51,340
Duchess said
one glass per girl.

403
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:53,609
Milk's expensive.

404
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:00,483
So, you really don't care
about him, Angel?

405
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:06,489
You can have him.

406
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:08,758
You'd be doing me a huge favor.

407
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:25,308
Hey.

408
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:29,679
Don't bother with Angel
tonight, sugar.

409
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:32,582
She wanted me to tell you that
you'd like me a lot better.

410
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,918
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

411
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:37,386
What else did Angel say?

412
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,656
That I'd be doing her
a huge favor

413
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,793
to take the farmer boy
off her hands.

414
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:45,996
She said that?

415
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:47,497
Yes.

416
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,032
Never been with a woman
like me before.

417
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,901
And as far as I can tell, I
never been with a man like you.

418
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:08,484
You again.

419
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:16,425
Your, um, your friend
just met me downstairs.

420
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:20,596
Told me you asked her
to take me off your hands.

421
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:24,001
I told you
you'd be wasting your time

422
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:25,701
and gold dust on me.

423
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:28,905
Don't worry about me.
I'm leaving town.

424
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:31,874
Headed back to the valley.

425
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:33,609
Back to the farm.

426
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:37,413
Well, go ahead.
I'm not stopping you.

427
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:39,082
Do you like the view here?

428
00:30:39,116 --> 00:30:40,950
Slapped-up shacks?

429
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:43,820
Drunk boys fighting in the mud?

430
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:46,589
Men paying money

431
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:49,559
to put their names into a hat

432
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:51,427
so they get the chance
to have sex with you?

433
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,496
- I didn't ask you to care.
- No, you didn't.

434
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,698
No, 'cause you don't
ask anything, do you?

435
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,001
No, 'cause you don't
need anything.

436
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:01,104
Or maybe-maybe it's just
'cause you don't feel anything.

437
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:02,738
That it?

438
00:31:02,772 --> 00:31:04,907
Wh-Why don't I just go
to your friend's room, hmm?

439
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,410
- Maybe she'll feel something.
- That's a great idea.

440
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:08,845
No, it is. She costs less, too.

441
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:10,047
You might as well leave
with a smile on your face.

442
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,681
Oh, you want to see me smile?

443
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:14,051
- Just say my name.
- What is your name?

444
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:15,551
Hmm?

445
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:17,887
'Cause I don't remember.

446
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:23,359
It's Michael.

447
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:32,135
Well, it's about time.

448
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:33,469
No, stop.

449
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:34,737
Hey, hey, stop.

450
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,040
Hey, stop. Stop.

451
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:38,774
We can't, we can't do this yet.

452
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:40,177
- What do you mean "yet"?
- Hey.

453
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,677
Hey, hey, hey.

454
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:48,384
We should wait till
it means something to you.

455
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:51,420
You're a damn fool.

456
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,724
I feel nothing for you.

457
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:57,727
Absolutely nothing.

458
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:03,432
You're a dirt farmer.

459
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:08,638
Yes, I am.

460
00:32:33,963 --> 00:32:37,067
Ain't Boston a grand city?

461
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,202
Told your mother
I would take good care of you.

462
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:50,013
Come on.

463
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:12,535
Upstairs.
Second door on the right.

464
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:14,937
My name is Sally.

465
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:16,139
What's yours, honey?

466
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:17,707
Oh, she's shy.

467
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,542
Don't mind her.

468
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:24,513
Take her home, please.

469
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:25,715
Just get her out of here.

470
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:27,883
Her mama's dead.

471
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:29,987
She'll be better off here

472
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,621
- in this fancy place with...
- No.

473
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:34,690
No, she won't.

474
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:00,649
Oh, yeah.

475
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:10,293
Oh, my. That's fine.

476
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:38,587
Are you enjoying my brandy?

477
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:40,556
Well, it's the best
I've ever tasted.

478
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:42,259
She's all yours.

479
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:44,660
As soon as you pay me.

480
00:34:46,396 --> 00:34:48,564
What's her name?

481
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:52,335
You can call her
whatever you want.

482
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:54,837
Take care of him.

483
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:03,946
Come here.

484
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,849
No, no. Don't move. Don't move.

485
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:10,653
Don't move.

486
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:17,127
Don't make a sound.
Don't make a sound.

487
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,694
Look.

488
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,854
You'll drink
when I pour you a drink.

489
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,835
Go through the pockets before
you dump the body, Colin.

490
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:02,105
There might be something
in there for you.

491
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,155
Come here.

492
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:22,159
Don't make me ask you again.

493
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:39,376
You have the look
of intelligence about you.

494
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,809
What's your name?

495
00:36:40,843 --> 00:36:42,312
Never mind.

496
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:46,082
You'll be my little Angel
from now on.

497
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,388
And as long as you do
exactly what I tell you,

498
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:53,223
we'll get along.

499
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:57,327
<i>"'He may live in my memory</i>

511
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:35,232
"Immediately"?

Alex.

521
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,991
This is Angel.

522
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:37,860
You are stunning.

523
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:44,200
Have we ever met before?

524
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:46,536
Could be.

525
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,107
You look like...
someone I used to know.

526
00:39:32,515 --> 00:39:34,551
<i>Alex Stafford
blew his brains out last night</i>

527
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:37,554
<i>when he found out he had sex
with his own daughter.</i>

528
00:39:37,587 --> 00:39:39,888
Don't look back.

529
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:41,257
Go.

530
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:46,196
<i>Now Angel's gone.</i>

531
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,499
<i>She was last seen
heading for the docks,</i>

532
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:53,336
<i>and Captain Sorenson's ship
left harbor yesterday.</i>

533
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:57,374
And who helped her
get out of the house?

534
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,143
Sally.

535
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:04,913
Well, before you kill her,
bring her to me.

536
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:35,911
We could make a heap
on this voyage to California.

537
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:39,182
Look at them all.

538
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:42,285
We might as well sell it.

539
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:44,988
Better than having them
take it for free.

540
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:47,590
I have a guy
who can handle our money.

541
00:40:47,624 --> 00:40:49,626
His cut is ten percent.

542
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:52,061
You okay with that?

543
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:55,031
I don't think I have a choice.

544
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:36,372
Put her down!

545
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,480
Found it.

546
00:41:43,513 --> 00:41:44,547
Let's go.

547
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:46,649
Hurry.

548
00:42:02,832 --> 00:42:05,001
Here. You need a drink.

549
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:07,203
No.

550
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:09,405
You sure you're not sick?

551
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:12,709
I was just thinking
about my mother.

552
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:15,144
What was she like?

553
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,548
Beautiful.

554
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:23,419
Shattered.

555
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:27,557
You're clammy.

556
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,259
I have a headache.

557
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,560
How long's it been aching?

558
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:34,197
Ever since that...

559
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,166
farmer started badgering me.

560
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,536
And you're sorry
you didn't go with him?

561
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:41,304
No.

562
00:42:41,337 --> 00:42:43,673
No. No man is gonna own me.

563
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:45,608
Yeah.

564
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:47,443
The Duchess wouldn't have
let you go anyway.

565
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,379
She can't keep me here.

566
00:42:49,412 --> 00:42:51,648
Like hell she can't.

567
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:53,516
No, we have a deal.

568
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,519
She holds my money, and then
when I'm ready, I walk.

569
00:42:56,553 --> 00:42:59,088
The only girls
who leave here are too old,

570
00:42:59,122 --> 00:43:02,258
too sick to work or dead.

571
00:43:07,263 --> 00:43:09,532
Who's there?

572
00:43:13,536 --> 00:43:15,638
Angel.

573
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:17,640
Come in.

574
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:19,175
You look dreadful.

575
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,244
Something troubling you?

576
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:22,545
You've been
working me too hard.

577
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:24,781
Nonsense.

578
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:26,482
Sit down, darling.

579
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:29,385
I heard you missed breakfast.
Would you like something?

580
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,525
I want my gold.

581
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,261
And why do you want it?

582
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:41,664
- Because it belongs to me.
- Mm.

583
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:44,334
Pour yourself some coffee.

584
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,703
I don't want coffee.
I want my gold.

585
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:50,506
Tell me,
why do you want your gold?

586
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,710
I would like to leave,
get my own place.

587
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:55,211
Mm.

588
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:57,213
Getting ambitious, are you?

589
00:43:57,246 --> 00:43:58,648
Trying to compete against me.

590
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:00,183
No.

591
00:44:00,216 --> 00:44:01,451
Be a hundred miles
from this place.

592
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:02,585
You don't have to worry
about me.

593
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:05,755
I just would like
to be left alone.

594
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:07,457
I take good care of you,
don't I?

595
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,325
Huh?

596
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,294
You'd be one woman
fighting off a hundred men.

597
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,529
How long would you last?

598
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:16,933
Maybe I'll get...

599
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:19,302
married or something.

600
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:22,405
You fancy doing laundry

601
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:23,940
and cooking for a man

602
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:27,677
and giving him sex whenever
and however he wants for free?

603
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,713
You know how to make a man
happy for 30 minutes.

604
00:44:30,747 --> 00:44:31,814
That's all you're good at.

605
00:44:31,848 --> 00:44:33,416
I want my gold, Duchess.

606
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:35,418
You are forgetting
what I do for you.

607
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:38,254
Everything costs money.

608
00:44:38,287 --> 00:44:39,722
You wear silk in a mining town.

609
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:41,958
I provide protection for you.
I feed you.

610
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:43,760
You live in a nice building.

611
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:45,662
Is my name on the deed?

612
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:49,666
- What did you say?
- You have coffee

613
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:51,334
with cream and sugar,

614
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:55,405
pastry from
that baker down the street

615
00:44:55,438 --> 00:44:58,241
and three eggs
and a steak on your...

616
00:44:58,841 --> 00:44:59,977
...your fine china.

617
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,311
I had oatmeal for breakfast

618
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:04,580
with two glasses of milk,
rationed.

619
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,483
How many men...

620
00:45:09,485 --> 00:45:12,588
...did I have to have sex with
so you could have this?

621
00:45:14,557 --> 00:45:17,694
You stuff yourself like a pig
and you dress up like royalty!

622
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,228
A duchess?

623
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:21,597
A duchess of what?!

624
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,399
Men don't even pay
to have sex with you anymore.

625
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:24,934
You have to pay Magowan
to have sex with you.

626
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:28,571
You forget where
I found you, missy.

627
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:33,276
In an alley, covered with mud,
broke and beaten bloody.

628
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:35,344
I made you a princess.

629
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:36,713
I can take it all away.

630
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:38,614
I'm sorry.

631
00:45:42,752 --> 00:45:43,820
You're ungrateful.

632
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:44,921
I don't know what I'm saying.

633
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:46,023
I can't do this anymore.

634
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:47,590
I have to get out of here.

635
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:49,325
That teacup came around
the Horn from England.

636
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:51,828
I'll add the cost of it
to your debt.

637
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:55,398
My debt?

638
00:45:55,431 --> 00:45:56,833
Magowan will take you
to your room

639
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:58,868
so you can discuss further
those thoughts you have

640
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:02,305
banging around that
pretty little head of yours.

641
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:08,878
You will be as obedient

642
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:11,748
as a street dog when I'm done with you!

643
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:13,616
You have no idea

644
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:16,886
how much I am gonna enjoy this.

645
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:26,029
What's so funny?

646
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:27,730
You.

647
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:34,403
You're just...

648
00:46:35,505 --> 00:46:37,907
You're just one of
Duchess's lapdogs.

649
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,576
She rings a bell
and you just come running.

650
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,778
And she owns you, too.

651
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:43,513
You're no different than
all of us.

652
00:46:43,546 --> 00:46:47,350
You're just one of Duchess's...
girls.

653
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:50,453
Hmm.

654
00:46:55,058 --> 00:46:56,359
I'm gonna kill you.

655
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:58,494
Do it. Do it!

656
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:29,625
Murphy, get him a drink.

657
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,762
- On the house.
- Yes, ma'am.

658
00:47:32,795 --> 00:47:35,498
No one goes up the stairs
without paying me first.

659
00:47:58,654 --> 00:48:00,690
Who did this to her?

660
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:03,860
Magowan. I made him leave.

661
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:08,431
Don't look at me like that.
It's her fault.

662
00:48:08,464 --> 00:48:09,799
She pushed him too far.

663
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:13,436
I'm taking her with me.

664
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,507
She's not leaving
until she pays me

665
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:19,809
every penny she owes me.

666
00:48:19,842 --> 00:48:21,811
Okay, well...

667
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:23,512
well, then...

668
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,648
Fine.

669
00:48:31,621 --> 00:48:33,556
Good luck with her.

670
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:49,438
Listen, I...

671
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:53,076
I-I know the timing
ain't perfect.

672
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,445
But, uh...

673
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:03,020
Will you marry me?

674
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:08,125
Sure.

675
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:12,561
- We'll get the preacher.
- Yeah.

676
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:13,829
He's down the street.

677
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:22,199
Good morning.

678
00:50:29,172 --> 00:50:31,540
Looks like you...

679
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:33,776
...got me after all.

680
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:36,579
Lucky you.

681
00:50:36,612 --> 00:50:39,149
Whatever Duchess had you pay,
you got cheated.

682
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:41,650
Well, you're beautiful, but
that's not why I married you.

683
00:50:41,684 --> 00:50:43,086
I'm gonna work off my debt,

684
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,921
and then I'm going back
to get what's mine.

685
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:51,128
Oh, uh...

686
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,096
you can wear these.

687
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:55,999
For now.

688
00:51:02,772 --> 00:51:05,242
Where's the wife
that goes with this dress?

689
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:07,910
Hope she isn't buried
under the house.

690
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:10,047
Oh, those belonged
to my sister Tess.

691
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,680
She, uh...

692
00:51:11,714 --> 00:51:13,749
She-she-she died last year.

693
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:18,788
Her husband Paul, we, uh...

694
00:51:19,855 --> 00:51:21,857
...we all came west together.

695
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:23,926
How far away is Pair-A-Dice?

696
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,662
A lifetime.

697
00:51:26,695 --> 00:51:27,763
In miles.

698
00:51:27,797 --> 00:51:29,965
About, uh, 20.

699
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,101
20 miles.

700
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,340
Well, I hope you don't mind
waiting a few days to...

701
00:51:37,374 --> 00:51:39,742
exercise your conjugal rights.

702
00:51:39,775 --> 00:51:40,943
Listen, uh, that...

703
00:51:40,977 --> 00:51:42,112
that's not why
I brought you here.

704
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:43,712
Mm-hmm.

705
00:51:43,746 --> 00:51:47,117
Well, you can take this back.

706
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,685
Marriage is over.

707
00:51:49,718 --> 00:51:52,189
Where did you get
a ring so fast?

708
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:53,856
It, uh...

709
00:51:54,857 --> 00:51:56,026
...belonged to my mother.

710
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:58,594
Y-You gave me
your mother's ring?

711
00:51:59,362 --> 00:52:00,930
Yeah.

712
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:04,733
Okay.

713
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:08,205
Whoa, hey. Oh.

714
00:52:09,805 --> 00:52:11,208
You know, shouldn't be
up for longer than

715
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:12,275
a few minutes at a time.

716
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:16,745
- Now, what hurts most?
- Nothing I want you touching.

717
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:24,020
I'm not staying here for long.

718
00:52:24,753 --> 00:52:29,159
I'm not playing into your
little marriage slave fantasy.

719
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:35,198
Marriage is not slavery.

720
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,368
Bad, bad dog.

721
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:13,270
Go home. Shoo.

722
00:53:13,303 --> 00:53:14,904
Get!

723
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:18,041
Go home! Go!

724
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:26,082
Go home.

725
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,717
Go get the stick.

726
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:30,819
Go on.

727
00:53:50,006 --> 00:53:51,174
Ha!

728
00:53:58,415 --> 00:53:59,983
Ow.

729
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:19,236
Leave me alone!

730
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:20,936
I'm going back.

731
00:54:24,574 --> 00:54:26,977
You don't own me!

732
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:42,192
You'll need water.

733
00:54:47,863 --> 00:54:49,932
It gets cold at night.

734
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,373
That way is Pair-A-Dice.

735
00:54:58,174 --> 00:55:00,176
19 more miles.

736
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,246
Duchess and Magowan waiting
for you at the end of the road.

737
00:55:05,948 --> 00:55:09,119
That way... is home.

738
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:12,289
One mile downhill.

739
00:55:13,922 --> 00:55:17,160
Fire, food...

740
00:55:18,328 --> 00:55:20,230
...and your husband.

741
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:24,234
Your choice.

742
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,015
Ha!

743
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,512
Why are you doing this?

744
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:55,351
One mile can be harder to walk
than 20.

745
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:12,435
Can you help me?

746
00:58:35,124 --> 00:58:37,093
I think it's time
to pay you back.

747
00:58:37,126 --> 00:58:39,162
- Pl-Please don't.
- Hmm?

748
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:50,507
Can I ask you something?

749
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,176
Yeah. I, uh...

750
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:55,512
Does your God
talk to you a lot?

751
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:58,581
He talks to everyone. I mean...

752
00:58:58,615 --> 00:59:01,017
My mama prayed.

753
00:59:02,218 --> 00:59:04,454
She prayed,
but God never heard her.

754
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:07,490
'Cause he doesn't care.

755
00:59:08,124 --> 00:59:12,161
So if you're telling me
that your God said marry me,

756
00:59:12,195 --> 00:59:13,796
you know he's punishing you.

757
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,332
'Cause that's what he does.

758
00:59:18,868 --> 00:59:21,104
Grinds people into dust.

759
00:59:28,578 --> 00:59:31,314
Go on. Go on.

760
00:59:55,104 --> 00:59:59,108
Listen, um,
this whole wife thing

761
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:01,177
isn't for me,
but I will play along

762
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,480
until I pay you back
what I owe you.

763
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:05,682
Hmm.

764
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:11,421
Well, we'll have to get
your strength back.

765
01:00:12,355 --> 01:00:15,091
Then we'll have you
out plowing the fields.

766
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:22,599
You like eggs?

767
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:23,733
Mm-hmm.

768
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:27,837
Well, these ones belong to us.

769
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,706
Go ahead, eat all you want.

770
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:33,443
- Go on.
- I...

771
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:34,744
- Go on.
- You...

772
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:37,547
Hey.

773
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,382
Hey, Mr. Chicken.

774
01:00:39,415 --> 01:00:40,783
Oh!

775
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:44,220
I'll teach you how to cook
roasted chicken, too.

776
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:47,890
Uh, no, no.

777
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:49,659
Right here.

778
01:00:54,797 --> 01:00:57,166
- Like that?
- Just like that.

779
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:04,374
Weeding is constant.

780
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:06,909
We're getting rid of the bad
and keeping the good.

781
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,245
Mm, so subtle.

782
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:10,713
Talk, talk, talk.

783
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:19,555
Not too fast.

784
01:01:36,572 --> 01:01:38,307
All right, give me the axe.

785
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:39,842
I-I don't think
that's a good id...

786
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:41,577
Give me the ax.

787
01:01:42,712 --> 01:01:44,347
Okay.

788
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:47,550
- Wait. O-O-Okay, now. Steady yourself.
- Shh.

789
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:49,218
Sorry.

790
01:01:51,954 --> 01:01:54,290
Oh. Whoa.

791
01:01:54,323 --> 01:01:56,325
- Come on.
- No, the wood is just too stiff.

792
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:58,261
Come on, I'll help you. Oh, the wood?

793
01:01:58,294 --> 01:01:59,562
That's the problem?
That's the problem?

794
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,297
Come on, I'll help you up.

795
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,466
- Look, it's still stuck.
- That's true, that's true.

796
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:04,300
Come on.

797
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,708
Come on.

798
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:14,210
There's room for two.

799
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:21,751
I'm fine right here.

800
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,758
I owe you.

801
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:33,496
Come on.

802
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:35,898
We're not ready.

803
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:40,737
I don't understand you.

804
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:44,340
I don't understand you either.

805
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:52,648
Uh, uh, I think, uh,
I think Maverick needs a walk.

806
01:02:53,783 --> 01:02:55,451
Uh, Maverick?

807
01:02:56,486 --> 01:02:58,521
Come on.

808
01:03:04,961 --> 01:03:06,863
What are you looking at?

809
01:03:16,372 --> 01:03:18,041
I'm gonna go saddle the horse
in the barn.

810
01:03:18,075 --> 01:03:19,642
Okay.

811
01:04:12,528 --> 01:04:15,598
Did you think
I couldn't find you?

812
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,968
- You belong to me, Angel.
- No! No!

813
01:04:19,002 --> 01:04:20,503
No!

814
01:04:20,536 --> 01:04:21,904
Angel, Angel! It's me.

815
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:23,040
It's fine.

816
01:04:23,073 --> 01:04:24,640
It's me, okay? It's me.

817
01:04:24,674 --> 01:04:27,978
It's just... just a nightmare.

818
01:04:29,046 --> 01:04:30,646
You want to talk about it?

819
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:33,116
No, I don't, I don't remember.

820
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,384
Your heart's beating so fast,
it's gonna come out your...

821
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:38,021
Don't... touch me, please.

822
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:41,490
Okay, come on.
Get your boots on.

823
01:04:41,524 --> 01:04:43,492
We are going for a walk.

824
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:45,494
It is the middle of the night.

825
01:04:45,528 --> 01:04:46,863
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

826
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:48,531
Well, you're going
whether you want to or not.

827
01:04:48,564 --> 01:04:51,767
Now, you can go like that...
or dressed.

828
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:52,902
It's your choice.

829
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:54,637
But you're going.

830
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:01,011
Come on, Angel.

831
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:02,812
What are you so afraid of?

832
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:07,050
Nothing.

833
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,419
Michael, where are you
taking me?

834
01:05:10,453 --> 01:05:11,520
You'll see.

835
01:05:11,554 --> 01:05:13,556
This is ridiculous.

836
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:15,025
I want to go back.

837
01:05:15,058 --> 01:05:17,194
We're almost there. Come on.

838
01:05:18,694 --> 01:05:20,496
Trust me.

839
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:25,434
We're here.

840
01:05:48,557 --> 01:05:50,227
Look.

841
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:03,140
That's the life
I want to offer you, Angel.

842
01:06:03,173 --> 01:06:07,110
One full of color and warmth

843
01:06:07,144 --> 01:06:09,679
and beauty and light.

844
01:06:13,582 --> 01:06:15,785
Just give me a chance.

845
01:06:19,122 --> 01:06:23,060
If you knew half of what I did,
you'd send me right back.

846
01:06:23,093 --> 01:06:26,829
Uh, listen, you did not choose
the life you had.

847
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:31,701
Okay? But you can choose
the life you want.

848
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:34,004
I chose to die.

849
01:06:37,007 --> 01:06:40,010
Well, you...
do you still want to?

850
01:06:45,115 --> 01:06:46,882
No.

851
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,119
- No, but...
- But?

852
01:06:49,152 --> 01:06:51,620
I don't know why I'm here.

853
01:06:52,289 --> 01:06:53,256
Why...

854
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,790
You say that I'm your wife,

855
01:06:54,824 --> 01:06:56,592
but you won't even...

856
01:06:58,561 --> 01:07:00,730
And it's... I don't blame you.

857
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:02,865
I don't. I-I...

858
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:07,137
I've just been waiting.

859
01:08:35,724 --> 01:08:37,960
Oh, Michael.

860
01:10:30,773 --> 01:10:31,874
Michael.

861
01:10:31,907 --> 01:10:33,842
Paul.

862
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:36,879
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

863
01:10:37,514 --> 01:10:40,217
I-I've missed you.

864
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,219
I miss, I miss you, too.

865
01:10:42,252 --> 01:10:43,486
Look at you.

866
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,820
Yeah, yeah.

867
01:10:44,853 --> 01:10:47,023
Yeah.

868
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:50,759
So, uh, so how was it
out there?

869
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:52,462
Uh, it-it was awful.

870
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:54,064
Yeah.

871
01:10:54,097 --> 01:10:56,499
Yeah, it was
a lot of hard work, uh,

872
01:10:56,533 --> 01:10:59,868
finding nothing and, uh...

873
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:03,273
...you know,
drinking to forget.

874
01:11:04,274 --> 01:11:05,841
No gold, then, or...?

875
01:11:05,874 --> 01:11:07,244
No, no, no. No.

876
01:11:07,277 --> 01:11:09,845
Not enough to buy a pot
to piss in at least, you know.

877
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:11,780
Just...

878
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:13,516
fighting for survival
out there, mostly.

879
01:11:15,884 --> 01:11:17,120
What about you?

880
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:20,123
- Uh...
- You look, uh...

881
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:23,759
Well, you always look content.

882
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:26,997
I got married.

883
01:11:30,433 --> 01:11:31,934
You're married?

884
01:11:32,901 --> 01:11:34,371
That's right.

885
01:11:36,406 --> 01:11:37,574
Yeah.

886
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:39,409
Well, uh,
congr-gratulations, Michael.

887
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:41,044
Thank you. Thank you.

888
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:42,279
Well, am I gonna meet her?

889
01:11:42,312 --> 01:11:44,180
You... What's she like?
Wh-Where is she?

890
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:46,316
Angel?

891
01:11:50,253 --> 01:11:52,888
This is, uh...

892
01:11:52,921 --> 01:11:55,091
This is Paul.

893
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,194
Paul, meet my wife, Angel.

894
01:11:58,827 --> 01:12:01,197
- Hello.
- Hello.

895
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:09,938
Um, uh...

896
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:14,077
I'm sorry to gape
at you, ma'am.

897
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:17,480
Those are, um...

898
01:12:18,148 --> 01:12:21,884
Those are T-Tess's clothes,
uh, the ones she made?

899
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:23,919
- Uh, yeah, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

900
01:12:23,952 --> 01:12:26,189
- Angel needed clothes. I...
- Mm-hmm.

901
01:12:26,222 --> 01:12:28,191
I thought Tess
would approve, so...

902
01:12:28,224 --> 01:12:30,293
Hmm.

903
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:34,230
Well, you must be hungry.

904
01:12:34,264 --> 01:12:35,964
Three weeks on that trail?

905
01:12:35,999 --> 01:12:37,634
- Mm. Mm.
- My God.

906
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,602
That was just on foot.

907
01:12:39,636 --> 01:12:41,371
Yeah, it was about seven total.

908
01:12:41,404 --> 01:12:43,006
Brutal.

909
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:44,374
Come on outside.

910
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:46,209
I'll show you what I did
to the barn since you left

911
01:12:46,242 --> 01:12:48,345
- to make your fortune.
- All right.

912
01:12:48,378 --> 01:12:50,180
Mm. I'm-a get a refill.

913
01:12:50,213 --> 01:12:51,481
Sure.

914
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:52,549
I'll be right there.

915
01:12:52,582 --> 01:12:54,117
Okay.

916
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:03,959
So Michael doesn't know
what you are, does he?

917
01:13:03,993 --> 01:13:06,496
- Should I remember you?
- Mm.

918
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:09,232
Well, I suppose all faces
start to look alike,

919
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:10,667
someone in your business, huh?

920
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,435
Yeah, and everything else, too.

921
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:15,238
Yeah, seeing you
in my wife's clothes

922
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:17,240
makes me sick to my stomach.

923
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:19,309
- I'd like to rip 'em off you.
- I bet you would.

924
01:13:19,342 --> 01:13:21,378
Michael is the best man
that I know,

925
01:13:21,411 --> 01:13:24,247
and he deserves
a decent girl, not...

926
01:13:25,515 --> 01:13:26,549
...you.

927
01:13:28,151 --> 01:13:30,453
Wh-What'd you do to get
your claws into him, huh?

928
01:13:30,487 --> 01:13:33,623
Well, Michael came to the
Palace, he paid for my time,

929
01:13:33,656 --> 01:13:36,993
and then he begged me to marry him.

930
01:13:37,026 --> 01:13:38,495
That's a lie.

931
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:41,664
I know Michael, and
Michael would never step foot

932
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:43,199
inside of a whorehouse.

933
01:13:43,233 --> 01:13:46,336
Well, the whore is here now.

934
01:13:48,171 --> 01:13:50,973
So I guess you're just
gonna have to deal with that.

935
01:14:06,089 --> 01:14:07,991
Oh, no, I don't.

936
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,701
Look at the new hayloft.

937
01:14:20,603 --> 01:14:22,105
Yeah.

938
01:14:22,138 --> 01:14:23,506
Come on, give me a hand
with this.

939
01:14:31,648 --> 01:14:34,717
I-I-I need to talk to you
about something, Michael.

940
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:36,986
It's about Angel.

941
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:40,290
Sh-She's not
who you think she is.

942
01:14:42,058 --> 01:14:44,360
She's exactly
who I think she is.

943
01:14:45,462 --> 01:14:46,729
She's my wife.

944
01:14:46,763 --> 01:14:48,698
Michael, before
she was your wife...

945
01:14:49,432 --> 01:14:52,602
...she was the highest priced
whore in Pair-A-Dice.

946
01:14:52,635 --> 01:14:54,471
I know all about that.

947
01:14:54,504 --> 01:14:56,139
Y-You know?

948
01:14:56,172 --> 01:14:58,374
- Yes.
- Michael, listen to me.

949
01:14:58,408 --> 01:15:00,543
She has been with
thousands of men.

950
01:15:00,577 --> 01:15:02,011
She just does not love you.

951
01:15:02,045 --> 01:15:03,079
She is using you.

952
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:06,049
You have no idea who she is.

953
01:15:06,683 --> 01:15:08,551
Well, maybe you should
look at your own life

954
01:15:08,585 --> 01:15:10,286
- instead of judging hers.
- Well, what do you think

955
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,721
your mother'd say about
marrying a piece of trash

956
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:13,656
- like that?
- Yeah. "Trash."

957
01:15:14,491 --> 01:15:18,361
If you love me like a brother,
then you will love her as well.

958
01:15:19,796 --> 01:15:21,531
Understand?

959
01:15:23,066 --> 01:15:24,667
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

960
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,404
Uh...

961
01:15:30,206 --> 01:15:31,674
I mean, Tess was my sister.

962
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:34,777
Okay? You're not, you're not
the only one suffering.

963
01:15:38,147 --> 01:15:39,482
I'm sorry. Come on.

964
01:15:41,284 --> 01:15:43,086
Come on.

965
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,495
You need supplies.

966
01:15:52,529 --> 01:15:54,397
Okay, go to Pair-A-Dice.

967
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,799
Uh, I'll give you enough money
to get what you need.

968
01:15:56,833 --> 01:16:00,270
You can, you can borrow
Shadrach and the wagon.

969
01:16:00,303 --> 01:16:03,506
And buy another horse
while you're there.

970
01:16:06,175 --> 01:16:08,311
Listen, the town
has a preacher.

971
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:12,115
Go to church.

972
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:15,652
Try to remember
the man you were...

973
01:16:16,753 --> 01:16:19,155
...when you married my sister.

974
01:16:23,326 --> 01:16:26,162
Paul needs to sort things out.

975
01:16:26,195 --> 01:16:28,231
He's coming over tomorrow
for the horse and wagon

976
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:30,333
to go into town.

977
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:35,138
He was mad because
I didn't remember him.

978
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:38,174
The truth is I don't know.

979
01:16:39,742 --> 01:16:42,812
Every man looks the same
without clothes on.

980
01:16:42,845 --> 01:16:44,314
You're not that person anymore.

981
01:16:44,347 --> 01:16:46,883
I'll always be that person.

982
01:16:48,518 --> 01:16:51,087
I don't care what you've done.

983
01:16:51,688 --> 01:16:53,456
See, I...

984
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:56,159
I just want
to build a life with you.

985
01:16:57,327 --> 01:16:59,495
I want to have children
with you.

986
01:17:01,631 --> 01:17:04,567
- Michael...
- A new beginning. Hmm?

987
01:17:06,502 --> 01:17:08,237
A family.

988
01:17:18,581 --> 01:17:23,319
I taught you how to be careful,
so this wouldn't happen.

989
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,656
Dr. Smith's gonna
take care of the problem.

990
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,525
So it never happens again.

991
01:17:31,628 --> 01:17:32,895
No!

992
01:17:32,929 --> 01:17:35,231
No! No! Please don't take...

993
01:17:35,264 --> 01:17:36,232
Please don't take...

994
01:17:36,265 --> 01:17:37,634
Please, my baby!

995
01:17:37,667 --> 01:17:39,369
My baby! No!

996
01:17:41,404 --> 01:17:44,540
I told you what would happen
if you disobeyed me.

997
01:17:44,574 --> 01:17:46,643
Please.

998
01:17:47,844 --> 01:17:49,512
Please!

999
01:18:08,631 --> 01:18:11,668
Wait! Wait.

1000
01:18:12,402 --> 01:18:15,171
- Wait, wait.
- Whoa.

1001
01:18:17,273 --> 01:18:18,941
What do you want?

1002
01:18:18,976 --> 01:18:20,643
I want a ride.

1003
01:18:22,879 --> 01:18:25,381
Yeah, 'cause you're running
off on him, aren't you?

1004
01:18:25,415 --> 01:18:27,417
Oh, you want me to stay?

1005
01:18:28,986 --> 01:18:30,553
Well, come on.

1006
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:32,655
Gonna take us all day
to get to town.

1007
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,602
You, uh... you want a drink?

1008
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:21,971
- Yeah.
- Hold on, now.

1009
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:25,775
You got to say "please"
if you want one.

1010
01:19:27,077 --> 01:19:28,745
Please.

1011
01:19:51,001 --> 01:19:53,536
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1012
01:20:04,413 --> 01:20:05,848
Tell me something.

1013
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:10,286
How'd you really meet Michael?
Hmm?

1014
01:20:11,387 --> 01:20:14,690
- I already told you how all of this came about.
- Liar.

1015
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:17,960
Michael didn't go into
any brothel.

1016
01:20:17,995 --> 01:20:19,762
There's no need to be jealous.

1017
01:20:19,796 --> 01:20:22,765
Now that I'm gone, you can have
Michael all to yourself.

1018
01:20:39,582 --> 01:20:41,818
You owe me for the ride.

1019
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,427
What exactly
did you have in mind?

1020
01:20:52,495 --> 01:20:56,866
You know, I never did make it
upstairs to the Palace.

1021
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,570
But I have always wondered

1022
01:21:00,603 --> 01:21:04,574
what it might be like
to make it inside Angel's...

1023
01:21:05,942 --> 01:21:07,677
...inner sanctum.

1024
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:12,481
And now you want to know.

1025
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,885
Mm-hmm.

1026
01:21:17,854 --> 01:21:19,622
Maybe I do.

1027
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,588
Well...

1028
01:21:52,622 --> 01:21:54,790
might as well do it now
or we'd...

1029
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:58,427
...never get there before dark.

1030
01:21:59,062 --> 01:22:00,429
What'd you have in mind?

1031
01:22:00,463 --> 01:22:02,565
Whatever you want, mister.

1032
01:22:02,598 --> 01:22:05,501
Long as I can get a ride.

1033
01:22:06,602 --> 01:22:08,738
Or was that all a bluff?

1034
01:23:11,268 --> 01:23:13,502
Let's go!

1035
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,471
Come on.

1036
01:23:16,939 --> 01:23:18,607
Come on.

1037
01:23:37,327 --> 01:23:40,030
Whoa. Whoa.

1038
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:46,969
Go on. Get down.

1039
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:51,674
I don't want
to be seen with you.

1040
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:07,523
You know, I never pretended
to be anything but what I am.

1041
01:24:09,192 --> 01:24:10,860
But you?

1042
01:24:12,195 --> 01:24:15,698
You took Michael's money,
you took his...

1043
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:18,035
his wagon...

1044
01:24:18,068 --> 01:24:20,836
his horse,
and then you took his wife.

1045
01:24:21,471 --> 01:24:24,107
Call yourself his brother.

1046
01:24:29,678 --> 01:24:31,680
Walk on.

1047
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,084
It burned down, Angel.

1048
01:25:08,251 --> 01:25:09,652
When?

1049
01:25:09,685 --> 01:25:11,720
About five weeks back.

1050
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:13,956
Last real excitement
we've had in this town.

1051
01:25:16,259 --> 01:25:18,794
It's good to see you, Angel.

1052
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:20,696
Assuming that marriage thing
didn't work out.

1053
01:25:20,729 --> 01:25:22,832
Where's Duchess?

1054
01:25:22,865 --> 01:25:24,201
I came back
to get what she owes me.

1055
01:25:24,234 --> 01:25:26,936
She didn't even have
a thimble to spit in.

1056
01:25:26,969 --> 01:25:28,971
Magowan burned the whole thing
down around her.

1057
01:25:29,005 --> 01:25:32,075
We caught up with him,
hung him.

1058
01:25:32,109 --> 01:25:34,111
Two of the girls died
in the fire.

1059
01:25:34,144 --> 01:25:35,678
Which ones?

1060
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:37,880
Mai Ling.

1061
01:25:37,913 --> 01:25:40,749
Little Chinese flower.
I liked her.

1062
01:25:41,784 --> 01:25:43,120
And the other?

1063
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:45,921
Loudmouth drunk.

1064
01:25:47,157 --> 01:25:48,858
What was her name?

1065
01:25:48,891 --> 01:25:51,627
- Lucky.
- Yeah, that's her.

1066
01:25:52,295 --> 01:25:53,997
They were trapped upstairs.

1067
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:55,432
Screaming.

1068
01:25:55,465 --> 01:25:57,234
Awful way to die.

1069
01:25:59,735 --> 01:26:01,171
Come see my place.

1070
01:26:01,837 --> 01:26:04,241
Whiskey's fine.

1071
01:26:10,946 --> 01:26:13,150
Got a spare room upstairs.

1072
01:26:15,784 --> 01:26:17,753
You could be back in business
in five minutes.

1073
01:26:17,786 --> 01:26:19,722
Just say the word.

1074
01:26:22,192 --> 01:26:25,095
All we got to do
is figure out the cut.

1075
01:26:26,363 --> 01:26:28,664
What do you say, Angel?

1076
01:26:37,073 --> 01:26:39,775
Fifty-fifty.
They pay me, I pay you.

1077
01:26:39,808 --> 01:26:42,112
Mm. Fair enough.

1078
01:26:46,116 --> 01:26:48,717
Providing you give me
what I want whenever I want it,

1079
01:26:48,751 --> 01:26:50,686
and it's free.

1080
01:27:18,948 --> 01:27:21,884
Hey, whoa. Whoa there.

1081
01:27:21,917 --> 01:27:23,353
I stopped by my place,
you know,

1082
01:27:23,386 --> 01:27:25,455
un-unload the supplies
is why it took me so long.

1083
01:27:25,488 --> 01:27:27,057
You took her back.

1084
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:31,127
She asked me to, Michael. I...

1085
01:27:31,927 --> 01:27:34,830
I-I tried to,
I tried to warn you.

1086
01:27:34,863 --> 01:27:35,898
I'm-I'm sorry.

1087
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:38,001
Go home, Paul.

1088
01:27:39,002 --> 01:27:40,103
Now.

1089
01:27:40,136 --> 01:27:42,938
Before I kill you
with my bare hands.

1090
01:27:57,287 --> 01:27:58,887
All right, come on.

1091
01:28:06,129 --> 01:28:08,331
Hey. Hey!

1092
01:28:08,365 --> 01:28:10,899
Hey, where you think
you're going?!

1093
01:28:18,174 --> 01:28:20,277
...your eyes like that,
I don't know any...

1094
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:21,944
Get out!

1095
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:24,481
Do you want to stay here?

1096
01:28:24,514 --> 01:28:27,217
Come on. Come on.

1097
01:28:30,253 --> 01:28:32,188
- She stays here!
- Yeah.

1098
01:28:32,222 --> 01:28:33,990
Stay there.

1099
01:28:37,994 --> 01:28:39,262
Jesus!

1100
01:28:46,436 --> 01:28:47,803
Let's go.

1101
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,197
Did Paul tell you about
what we did?

1102
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:16,899
He didn't have to.

1103
01:29:16,932 --> 01:29:18,635
The guilt was written
all over his face.

1104
01:29:18,668 --> 01:29:20,370
Then why did you come for me?

1105
01:29:20,403 --> 01:29:23,473
- Why didn't you just leave me where I belong?
- Because...

1106
01:29:23,506 --> 01:29:25,208
I love you.

1107
01:30:26,102 --> 01:30:28,071
Stop. Angel, stop.

1108
01:30:28,104 --> 01:30:29,305
- I'm not clean.
- Angel, hey.

1109
01:30:29,339 --> 01:30:31,007
Don't-don't touch me.
I'm not...

1110
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,175
- Hey, hey, stop, stop.
- I'm not clean.

1111
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:35,412
Let 'em go. It's okay.
It's okay.

1112
01:30:35,445 --> 01:30:38,114
It's okay. It's okay.

1113
01:30:38,148 --> 01:30:39,983
- Come on.
- I'm not clean, Michael.

1114
01:30:40,016 --> 01:30:42,719
Hey, hey. Hey.

1115
01:30:42,752 --> 01:30:45,221
Look at me, okay?

1116
01:30:46,055 --> 01:30:47,991
I forgive you.

1117
01:30:48,591 --> 01:30:50,160
I forgive you.

1118
01:30:50,193 --> 01:30:52,061
Come on.

1119
01:31:07,377 --> 01:31:09,179
You have to stop thinking
that I'm gonna be

1120
01:31:09,212 --> 01:31:11,648
something that I'm not.

1121
01:31:11,681 --> 01:31:14,083
I don't know how to love.

1122
01:31:14,717 --> 01:31:17,220
I've got too many demons.

1123
01:31:18,087 --> 01:31:20,290
My father was my demon.

1124
01:31:25,662 --> 01:31:27,597
He was a plantation owner.

1125
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:29,499
Slaves.

1126
01:31:31,367 --> 01:31:35,971
I told him when he died,
I'd free them all.

1127
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:41,044
So he beat me bloody...

1128
01:31:42,212 --> 01:31:45,148
...dragged me down
to the slaves' quarters.

1129
01:31:45,181 --> 01:31:47,150
Said I should see
how animals live

1130
01:31:47,183 --> 01:31:49,486
since I loved them so much.

1131
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,288
Ezra...

1132
01:31:53,523 --> 01:31:57,193
...an old slave,
took care of me, and, uh...

1133
01:31:58,261 --> 01:32:00,196
...mm, taught me about God.

1134
01:32:01,498 --> 01:32:03,266
And forgiveness.

1135
01:32:03,933 --> 01:32:07,770
So I took Ezra
down to the bayou and, uh...

1136
01:32:07,804 --> 01:32:10,273
set him free.

1137
01:32:10,306 --> 01:32:12,475
What about your father?
What did he do?

1138
01:32:12,509 --> 01:32:16,312
He wanted me to learn
the benefits of ownership,

1139
01:32:16,346 --> 01:32:20,016
so he sent a young slave girl
to my room.

1140
01:32:22,485 --> 01:32:25,154
Told me she was there
for me to, uh...

1141
01:32:26,723 --> 01:32:29,092
...to do with what I pleased.

1142
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,463
I packed up and left
that night.

1143
01:32:33,496 --> 01:32:35,131
- Never looked back.
- And the girl?

1144
01:32:35,164 --> 01:32:37,133
Did... did you?

1145
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:39,469
No, I did not.

1146
01:32:41,871 --> 01:32:44,140
See, sometimes
you have to leave behind

1147
01:32:44,173 --> 01:32:47,277
what you were born into
to become who...

1148
01:32:48,845 --> 01:32:50,580
...who God meant you to be.

1149
01:32:55,718 --> 01:32:58,788
Been thinking about
planting fruit trees.

1150
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:02,492
Over there.

1151
01:33:03,326 --> 01:33:05,328
What about walnuts?

1152
01:33:07,564 --> 01:33:09,432
Mm. Good idea.

1153
01:33:10,533 --> 01:33:14,437
Fruit all summer,
nuts in the fall.

1154
01:34:01,184 --> 01:34:02,485
I got a fish!

1155
01:34:02,518 --> 01:34:03,319
Ah!

1156
01:34:03,353 --> 01:34:05,555
I got a fish!

1157
01:34:18,534 --> 01:34:20,403
Whoa now. Whoa now.

1158
01:34:20,436 --> 01:34:22,238
Whoa now.

1159
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:23,706
Damn wheel.

1160
01:34:24,774 --> 01:34:26,509
Need some help?

1161
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:28,177
That'd be mighty kind
of you, sir.

1162
01:34:28,211 --> 01:34:29,812
- What'd you hit?
- Hi.

1163
01:34:29,846 --> 01:34:31,447
Can you please help us?

1164
01:34:31,481 --> 01:34:33,249
My mom's in so much pain.

1165
01:34:33,282 --> 01:34:34,884
When is the baby due?

1166
01:34:34,917 --> 01:34:36,419
About this time last week.

1167
01:34:36,452 --> 01:34:37,954
She's not doing well.

1168
01:34:37,988 --> 01:34:39,922
Where you looking to settle?

1169
01:34:39,956 --> 01:34:41,824
- I really like Oregon.
- Oregon?

1170
01:34:41,858 --> 01:34:44,460
We have the best farmland
west of the Rockies right here.

1171
01:34:44,494 --> 01:34:46,362
- I have 300 acres.
- Let's go give this to your ma.

1172
01:34:46,396 --> 01:34:47,764
And Paul's got just as much,

1173
01:34:47,797 --> 01:34:49,632
and-and there's more
available land next to him.

1174
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:51,367
- Thank you.
- See, the thing about the California soil...

1175
01:34:51,401 --> 01:34:53,469
Thank you so much
for your kindness.

1176
01:34:53,503 --> 01:34:55,605
We've been living in that wagon
for over a year.

1177
01:34:55,638 --> 01:34:57,840
I'd forgotten what it feels
like to be in a real bed.

1178
01:34:57,874 --> 01:35:01,444
I don't know what we would have
done if you hadn't come along.

1179
01:35:01,477 --> 01:35:03,246
Mama wasn't doing well.

1180
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:05,548
This baby can't stay
in the womb much longer.

1181
01:35:07,283 --> 01:35:09,652
Hey, uh, hold on. I got it.

1182
01:35:10,286 --> 01:35:12,789
- Attach it down there.
- Okay.

1183
01:35:12,822 --> 01:35:15,458
Just connect it down there.

1184
01:35:15,491 --> 01:35:17,827
Michael, do you have...

1185
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:20,697
How did you and Michael
come to California?

1186
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:23,966
Oh, he came by land,
and I came by ship.

1187
01:35:24,001 --> 01:35:26,402
How did you two meet?

1188
01:35:27,704 --> 01:35:31,441
He rescued me from
a brothel in Pair-A-Dice.

1189
01:35:36,412 --> 01:35:38,314
Oh, you mean it.

1190
01:35:38,347 --> 01:35:40,349
I'm-I'm sorry.

1191
01:35:40,383 --> 01:35:41,818
Mama always says
I shouldn't pry,

1192
01:35:41,851 --> 01:35:43,786
but I just want
to know you better.

1193
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:46,222
I like you.

1194
01:35:46,923 --> 01:35:47,924
You like me?

1195
01:35:47,957 --> 01:35:49,993
Yes.

1196
01:35:50,027 --> 01:35:51,828
Can you forgive me?

1197
01:35:51,861 --> 01:35:53,362
I want us to be friends.

1198
01:35:53,396 --> 01:35:55,531
Why do you want
to be my friend?

1199
01:35:55,565 --> 01:35:56,933
Well-well, you're kind

1200
01:35:56,966 --> 01:35:59,669

Elizabeth and I have decided
on a name for our youngest son.

1225
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,941
Michael.

1226
01:37:44,974 --> 01:37:46,442
Michael Benjamin Altman.

1227
01:37:49,645 --> 01:37:52,448
Well, I'm honored, truly.
Th-Thank you.

1228
01:37:52,481 --> 01:37:54,951
I have another announcement.

1229
01:37:54,985 --> 01:37:56,153
We're staying.

1230
01:37:56,186 --> 01:37:57,587
With Michael's help,

1231
01:37:57,620 --> 01:37:59,455
I bought the land
just east of Paul's,

1232
01:37:59,488 --> 01:38:01,457
and he's rounded up a few men,

1233
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:02,993
and we'll have a cabin up
in a few weeks.

1234
01:38:04,427 --> 01:38:05,595
Thank heavens.

1235
01:38:05,628 --> 01:38:06,863
If you'd put me back
on that wagon,

1236
01:38:06,896 --> 01:38:08,664
I'd have shot ya.

1237
01:38:08,698 --> 01:38:10,867
- We're staying.
- Congratulations.

1238
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,468
Michael. Yeah.

1239
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,609
Welcome to
the neighborhood, partner.

1240
01:38:19,642 --> 01:38:20,910
Thank you.

1241
01:38:20,943 --> 01:38:22,879
- It's right over yonder.
- It is.

1242
01:38:22,912 --> 01:38:25,681
I'm, uh, I'm glad
you came, Paul.

1243
01:38:25,715 --> 01:38:27,717
Mm-hmm.

1244
01:38:32,588 --> 01:38:34,657
Miriam is...

1245
01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:36,559
she's a beautiful girl.

1246
01:38:36,592 --> 01:38:38,494
Mm, she is.

1247
01:38:38,527 --> 01:38:39,795
And you two have
a lot in common.

1248
01:38:39,829 --> 01:38:42,165
You get along so well.

1249
01:38:42,199 --> 01:38:43,499
You jealous of her?

1250
01:38:45,902 --> 01:38:47,137
No, that's not it.

1251
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:48,471
You have no reason
to be jealous.

1252
01:38:48,504 --> 01:38:50,406
I'm not jealous.

1253
01:38:51,074 --> 01:38:54,911
She can just give you
more than I can offer you.

1254
01:38:54,944 --> 01:38:57,546
I want you.

1255
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,548
No one else.

1256
01:39:03,519 --> 01:39:05,488
Well, you want children.

1257
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:07,857
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1258
01:39:10,559 --> 01:39:12,662
I can't have children.

1259
01:39:17,533 --> 01:39:18,935
You can't know that.

1260
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,938
I got pregnant once.

1261
01:39:22,571 --> 01:39:25,541
And Duke, um, he had a doctor,

1262
01:39:25,574 --> 01:39:27,677
and he said
that he would make sure

1263
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:29,712
that it would never
happen again.

1264
01:39:30,347 --> 01:39:32,682
Michael! I need help!

1265
01:39:32,715 --> 01:39:34,517
The sheep are loose!

1266
01:39:39,588 --> 01:39:41,024
Listen to me.

1267
01:39:42,525 --> 01:39:44,727
I love you.

1268
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,463
Nothing's gonna change that.

1269
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:56,039
Nothing is impossible.

1270
01:40:33,642 --> 01:40:35,078
What are we celebrating?

1271
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:38,081
- Us.
- Hmm?

1272
01:40:44,154 --> 01:40:45,654
Dinner first.

1273
01:40:51,194 --> 01:40:53,130
That was delicious.

1274
01:40:55,298 --> 01:40:56,966
Mmm.

1275
01:41:08,811 --> 01:41:11,181
Let's go to the hilltop

1276
01:41:11,214 --> 01:41:14,184
<i>where you first showed me
the sunrise.</i>

1277
01:41:39,842 --> 01:41:41,344
You know,
I never paid attention

1278
01:41:41,378 --> 01:41:44,047
to sunrises and sunsets...

1279
01:41:44,981 --> 01:41:47,583
...till you brought me here.

1280
01:41:54,657 --> 01:41:56,725
What's gotten into you?

1281
01:42:03,866 --> 01:42:06,169
Just want you to have
a good night.

1282
01:42:29,993 --> 01:42:31,794
I love you.

1283
01:43:20,809 --> 01:43:23,812
Excuse me. Mister? Hey.

1284
01:43:23,846 --> 01:43:25,915
- Uh, can I get...
- Yep.

1285
01:43:25,948 --> 01:43:28,118
Are you going into town?

1286
01:43:28,151 --> 01:43:29,685
Mm-hmm.

1287
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,088
Get in.

1288
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:35,791
There you go.

1289
01:43:35,824 --> 01:43:37,860
Hyah. Hyah.

1290
01:43:45,502 --> 01:43:47,703
Wh-Where's Angel?

1291
01:43:48,438 --> 01:43:49,939
Gone.

1292
01:43:49,972 --> 01:43:53,709
Sh-She, um...
she left this for me.

1293
01:43:56,513 --> 01:43:59,282
You have to go after her.

1294
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:01,117
She has free will.

1295
01:44:01,917 --> 01:44:04,254
It has to be her choice.

1296
01:44:18,134 --> 01:44:19,236
Mister?

1297
01:44:21,037 --> 01:44:24,107
I think you need a better cook.

1298
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:28,144
We hired one, but he left
for the goldfields.

1299
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:29,945
Well, hire me.

1300
01:44:32,015 --> 01:44:36,219
I can bake pies
and bread and biscuits.

1301
01:44:37,853 --> 01:44:40,856
You can call it
"Mama's Home Cooking."

1302
01:44:45,894 --> 01:44:48,031
Name's Virgil Harper.

1303
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,901
Mama's Home Cooking.

1304
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:55,838
You got yourself a job, missy.

1305
01:44:58,408 --> 01:44:59,942
Well, I need a place to stay.

1306
01:44:59,976 --> 01:45:01,944
You can have
the cook's quarters.

1307
01:45:01,978 --> 01:45:04,180
It's right off the kitchen.

1308
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:08,351
There's a good lock
on the door.

1309
01:45:13,256 --> 01:45:15,392
You're gonna work yourself
to death.

1310
01:45:16,559 --> 01:45:18,261
Keeps me from thinking
too much.

1311
01:45:18,295 --> 01:45:23,099
Paul says Angel's probably
in Sacramento or San Francisco.

1312
01:45:23,133 --> 01:45:25,101
What else did Paul say?

1313
01:45:25,135 --> 01:45:27,170
Just go after her, Michael.

1314
01:45:27,203 --> 01:45:28,471
Bring her back
where she belongs.

1315
01:45:28,505 --> 01:45:30,307
You want to help?

1316
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:32,375
Pray for her.

1317
01:45:33,443 --> 01:45:35,178
That's what I'm doing.

1318
01:45:38,148 --> 01:45:41,017
- Are you doing all right?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

1319
01:45:42,052 --> 01:45:44,187
All right. So this is yours.

1320
01:45:58,001 --> 01:46:00,136
- Pass it down!
- Got it.

1321
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:01,604
- Hurry!
- Here, here.

1322
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:07,110
- Hurry up! Let's go!
- Hurry!

1323
01:46:07,143 --> 01:46:08,545
Come on, bring up the next one!
Let's go!

1324
01:46:08,578 --> 01:46:10,146
- Hurry up!
- Keep it coming!

1325
01:46:13,516 --> 01:46:14,984
There you go!

1326
01:46:15,018 --> 01:46:16,586
- Come on!
- Keep it moving!

1327
01:46:28,565 --> 01:46:31,067
Jesus, let me go after her.

1328
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:35,071
Let me, Lord, please.

1329
01:46:38,174 --> 01:46:41,378
Or just give me the strength
to hold tight.

1330
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:08,071
Hello, Angel.

1331
01:47:12,275 --> 01:47:15,078
It's been a long, long time.

1332
01:47:18,081 --> 01:47:19,582
It's fate that I find you

1333
01:47:19,616 --> 01:47:22,118
only a couple of blocks
from my front door.

1334
01:47:24,454 --> 01:47:28,324
Did you come to... all the way
to California just to find me?

1335
01:47:28,358 --> 01:47:30,193
Well, circumstances
changed in Boston,

1336
01:47:30,226 --> 01:47:33,329
but then there are fortunes
to be made here

1337
01:47:33,363 --> 01:47:36,533
and few laws on how it's done.

1338
01:47:36,566 --> 01:47:38,168
Shall we go?

1339
01:47:38,201 --> 01:47:39,569
All that I have to do
is scream,

1340
01:47:39,602 --> 01:47:43,440
and a dozen men will come help
a lady in distress.

1341
01:47:43,473 --> 01:47:45,442
Open your mouth,

1342
01:47:45,475 --> 01:47:49,479
and I'll have Colin kill Virgil
Harper some dark foggy night.

1343
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,215
You...

1344
01:47:53,049 --> 01:47:55,018
...a cook?

1345
01:47:56,486 --> 01:47:59,422
Ah, it's a pity
the café burned down.

1346
01:48:28,051 --> 01:48:29,252
Leave us, Rosie.

1347
01:48:29,285 --> 01:48:31,521
Take the key.

1348
01:48:32,188 --> 01:48:34,524
Lock her in the room next door.

1349
01:48:34,557 --> 01:48:37,126
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
- No.

1350
01:48:42,532 --> 01:48:43,800
How old is she, Duke?

1351
01:48:45,401 --> 01:48:47,770
I need you to get cleaned up.

1352
01:48:47,804 --> 01:48:49,606
You're going onstage tonight.

1353
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:52,408
I need to put
my best prostitute on display.

1354
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:54,310
How old is she?

1355
01:48:55,678 --> 01:48:57,213
Eight?

1356
01:48:58,381 --> 01:48:59,249
Nine?

1357
01:48:59,282 --> 01:49:02,285
You jealous, Angel?

1358
01:49:03,553 --> 01:49:06,556
You never could handle a woman,
could you?

1359
01:49:08,157 --> 01:49:10,126
What's happened to you, dear?

1360
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:14,531
What's it gonna take
to bring my little Angel back?

1361
01:49:18,601 --> 01:49:20,603
Fill the bathtub up
with warm water.

1362
01:49:46,162 --> 01:49:48,298
Don't push me, Angel.

1363
01:49:48,331 --> 01:49:50,733
As fond as I am of you,

1364
01:49:50,767 --> 01:49:53,303
you're not indispensable.

1365
01:50:02,579 --> 01:50:06,649
If she gets away again,
I'll hold you accountable.

1366
01:50:07,283 --> 01:50:09,686
I'll be next door
with the girls.

1367
01:50:19,262 --> 01:50:20,597
- Come here!
- No!

1368
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:22,699
Get over here!

1369
01:50:22,732 --> 01:50:24,133
I said now!

1370
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:28,338
Get over here! Come here!

1371
01:50:33,843 --> 01:50:35,912
Please stop now! Please!

1372
01:50:35,945 --> 01:50:37,280
Please.

1373
01:50:38,781 --> 01:50:40,350
God!

1374
01:51:15,551 --> 01:51:17,687
My God.

1375
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:19,656
God, I want to believe.

1376
01:51:20,623 --> 01:51:21,591
I do.

1377
01:51:26,462 --> 01:51:29,899
If you're real,
please just help me.

1378
01:51:41,979 --> 01:51:43,413
<i>If you want revenge</i>

1379
01:51:43,446 --> 01:51:44,681
<i>for everything I've ever done,</i>

1380
01:51:44,714 --> 01:51:48,418
then so be it,
but those girls need you.

1381
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:50,753
<i>I need you.</i>

1382
01:51:52,655 --> 01:51:54,691
<i>Help me.</i>

1383
01:51:56,026 --> 01:51:57,995
<i>Please.</i>

1384
01:51:58,028 --> 01:51:59,562
<i>Wake up.</i>

1385
01:52:08,905 --> 01:52:10,640
I want to believe.

1386
01:52:15,478 --> 01:52:17,313
<i>Sarah.</i>

1387
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:33,262
Tell them the truth, darling.

1388
01:52:36,499 --> 01:52:39,602
I give you an Angel.

1389
01:52:58,421 --> 01:53:00,890
Feel the power, Angel.

1390
01:53:00,923 --> 01:53:02,725
We can share it.

1391
01:53:05,628 --> 01:53:07,497
We'll bring them
to their knees.

1392
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:28,718
Duke fancies little girls.

1393
01:53:28,751 --> 01:53:30,520
- What?
- What?

1394
01:53:30,553 --> 01:53:32,822
He has two locked away
upstairs right now.

1395
01:53:35,525 --> 01:53:39,062
He abuses us until we do
anything to survive.

1396
01:53:42,832 --> 01:53:45,935
I was eight years old
when he bought me.

1397
01:53:49,106 --> 01:53:50,640
I escaped when I was 17,

1398
01:53:50,673 --> 01:53:53,442
but he found me
and he forced me here.

1399
01:53:54,544 --> 01:53:56,612
Lies! All lies.

1400
01:53:56,646 --> 01:53:59,682
A scorned woman
tells lies, gentlemen.

1401
01:53:59,715 --> 01:54:00,383
Lies!

1402
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:02,451
And you're the father of lies.

1403
01:54:02,485 --> 01:54:04,121
Get over here!

1404
01:54:06,089 --> 01:54:08,391
Let-Let's dance. Let's dance.

1405
01:54:08,424 --> 01:54:09,826
Let's dance. All right.

1406
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:14,031
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

1407
01:54:16,966 --> 01:54:17,967
Goodbye, Angel.

1408
01:54:19,769 --> 01:54:21,571
Stay down.

1409
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:23,106
Go. Get out of here. Go.

1410
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:24,907
- Colin!
- Go.

1411
01:54:26,909 --> 01:54:28,578
That's enough.

1412
01:54:30,147 --> 01:54:31,480
Colin!

1413
01:54:31,514 --> 01:54:34,417
Quiet. Don't you dare.

1414
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:42,525
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna
get you girls out of here.

1415
01:54:42,558 --> 01:54:44,460
Colin!

1416
01:54:45,062 --> 01:54:47,396
Coming!

1417
01:54:57,174 --> 01:54:58,976
Come on.

1418
01:55:03,146 --> 01:55:04,947
There are little girls in here!

1419
01:55:07,917 --> 01:55:08,918
Hang Duke!

1420
01:55:10,187 --> 01:55:11,754
Hang Duke!

1421
01:55:27,904 --> 01:55:29,472
Godspeed.

1422
01:55:37,214 --> 01:55:39,515
There he is!

1423
01:56:07,311 --> 01:56:09,812
Oh, well,
she-she definitely did.

1424
01:56:14,251 --> 01:56:16,585
I'll see you.

1425
01:56:35,938 --> 01:56:39,642
...30, we got 2.648,

1426
01:56:39,675 --> 01:56:42,279
divided by 22,

1427
01:56:42,312 --> 01:56:44,147
multiplied by 60.

1428
01:56:44,181 --> 01:56:45,815
Don't forget the...

1429
01:56:45,848 --> 01:56:47,750
Ma'am.

1430
01:56:48,718 --> 01:56:50,720
Can I help you, sir?

1431
01:56:50,753 --> 01:56:52,122
I'm looking for a girl.

1432
01:56:52,155 --> 01:56:53,856
I bet you are.

1433
01:56:55,025 --> 01:56:56,726
Uh, she went by the name Angel.

1434
01:56:56,759 --> 01:56:59,762
Uh, I think I saw her
come in here yesterday.

1435
01:56:59,795 --> 01:57:01,597
Paul.

1436
01:57:04,767 --> 01:57:07,304
Wh-What is this place?

1437
01:57:07,337 --> 01:57:09,939
It is a shelter and a school.

1438
01:57:10,773 --> 01:57:13,876
For women like me
who want a new life.

1439
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:22,852
Do you, um...

1440
01:57:22,885 --> 01:57:24,720
ever go back to the valley?

1441
01:57:24,754 --> 01:57:27,290
Miriam told me you wanted
to go back to the goldfields.

1442
01:57:27,324 --> 01:57:29,026
She talked me out of it.

1443
01:57:29,059 --> 01:57:30,626
How is she?

1444
01:57:30,659 --> 01:57:32,628
Well...

1445
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:35,664
...she's in a family way.

1446
01:57:37,167 --> 01:57:38,934
Wow. That's...

1447
01:57:40,070 --> 01:57:42,671
Well, that is...
that's wonderful news.

1448
01:57:44,041 --> 01:57:46,143
Well...

1449
01:57:46,176 --> 01:57:48,644
guess you're gonna have to

1450
01:57:48,677 --> 01:57:50,313
help him build an addition
to the cabin.

1451
01:57:50,347 --> 01:57:51,680
He'll need it.

1452
01:57:51,714 --> 01:57:53,183
What for?

1453
01:57:53,216 --> 01:57:55,551
For the baby. He and Miriam
definitely need more room.

1454
01:57:57,220 --> 01:57:59,156
Miriam is my wife.

1455
01:57:59,189 --> 01:58:00,223
Not Michael's.

1456
01:58:05,295 --> 01:58:07,663
He's still waiting for you.

1457
01:58:07,696 --> 01:58:09,965
What?

1458
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,169
Why would you do that?
Why would you get in the way?

1459
01:58:12,202 --> 01:58:14,371
- Miriam is perfect for him.
- I didn't.

1460
01:58:14,404 --> 01:58:15,871
She's-she's innocent.
She's pure.

1461
01:58:15,905 --> 01:58:17,640
She's intelligent.
She knows how to love.

1462
01:58:17,673 --> 01:58:19,775
- She chose me.
- She loved him.

1463
01:58:19,809 --> 01:58:21,078
Like a brother, she loved him.

1464
01:58:21,111 --> 01:58:22,345
You need to go back
and you need to tell him

1465
01:58:22,379 --> 01:58:23,746
that you found out I was dead.

1466
01:58:23,779 --> 01:58:24,880
Do you hear me?

1467
01:58:24,914 --> 01:58:27,317
Cholera, consumption, anything.

1468
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:28,851
Michael has to find a nice girl

1469
01:58:28,884 --> 01:58:31,587
that can give him children,
Paul.

1470
01:58:33,156 --> 01:58:34,690
I can't.

1471
01:58:37,394 --> 01:58:38,828
Did...

1472
01:58:40,696 --> 01:58:42,865
- Did he know?
- Yes.

1473
01:58:44,267 --> 01:58:46,303
I told him.

1474
01:58:46,336 --> 01:58:48,838
So that's why you left?

1475
01:58:48,871 --> 01:58:50,739
You thought he would...

1476
01:58:50,773 --> 01:58:52,708
he would go to Miriam,
and they...

1477
01:59:03,019 --> 01:59:05,155
I was wrong about you, Angel.

1478
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:10,693
'Cause I hated you.

1479
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:14,264
But what you-you said to me

1480
01:59:14,297 --> 01:59:17,933
that day outside
Pair-A-Dice, I...

1481
01:59:20,036 --> 01:59:22,139
I knew you were right about me.

1482
01:59:24,007 --> 01:59:28,044
I'm a scoundrel and I betrayed
my brother and...

1483
01:59:32,315 --> 01:59:33,716
Angel?

1484
01:59:35,418 --> 01:59:37,853
Angel, will you...

1485
01:59:37,887 --> 01:59:39,855
will you forgive me?

1486
01:59:43,759 --> 01:59:46,163
I forgave you
a long time ago, Paul.

1487
01:59:48,231 --> 01:59:51,667
How could I not...

1488
01:59:52,335 --> 01:59:54,870
...with all the forgiveness
that I've been given?

1489
02:00:01,278 --> 02:00:03,079
Uh...

1490
02:00:09,752 --> 02:00:12,322
Come back with me.

1491
02:00:12,355 --> 02:00:15,091
Michael is suffering.

1492
02:00:24,501 --> 02:00:26,869
This has already been
hard enough.

1493
02:00:30,906 --> 02:00:32,708
I'm needed here.

1494
02:00:48,824 --> 02:00:51,528
The carriage
leaves my hotel at 4:00.

1495
02:00:51,561 --> 02:00:53,496
Please come with me.

1496
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:55,831
<i>He loves you.</i>

1497
02:01:29,399 --> 02:01:31,301
What are you thinking about?

1498
02:01:37,007 --> 02:01:38,541
I've missed you so much.

1499
02:01:38,575 --> 02:01:40,876
I missed you both.

1500
02:01:40,909 --> 02:01:42,245
Did you find her?

1501
02:01:44,913 --> 02:01:46,349
Go on.

1502
02:03:24,481 --> 02:03:27,083
My real name is Sarah.

1503
02:03:29,185 --> 02:03:31,388
And I've never told
anyone that.

1504
02:03:33,523 --> 02:03:35,291
Until now.

1505
02:03:38,061 --> 02:03:40,163
Because it was
the only thing that I had

1506
02:03:40,196 --> 02:03:42,399
that no one could take from me.

1507
02:03:46,302 --> 02:03:49,905
I came here to tell you
that I love you.

1508
02:03:53,576 --> 02:03:55,478
And I am so sorry.

1509
02:03:57,313 --> 02:03:58,381
I'm so sorry

1510
02:03:58,415 --> 02:04:01,284
for all of the pain
that I've caused you, Michael.

1511
02:04:06,089 --> 02:04:08,957
It's your pain that brought us
to this moment.

1512
02:04:30,814 --> 02:04:33,949
Keep it on this time,
will you, please?

1513
02:04:35,185 --> 02:04:37,420
I'll never take it off.

1514
02:04:41,791 --> 02:04:43,426
As long as I live.

1515
02:04:45,495 --> 02:04:47,197
Welcome home, Sarah.

1516
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:49,165
I've always loved you.

1517
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:52,368
Welcome home.

1518
02:05:21,531 --> 02:05:22,799
Come.

1519
02:05:22,832 --> 02:05:24,501
Come on, baby.

1520
02:05:25,535 --> 02:05:26,803
Yeah. Right here.

1521
02:05:26,836 --> 02:05:28,037
Okay, come.

1522
02:05:28,071 --> 02:05:30,406
Do you want to fish?

1523
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:31,808
Ready? Ready?

1524
02:05:33,142 --> 02:05:34,444
Oh, oh.

1525
02:05:34,477 --> 02:05:36,379
Good! Yeah!

1526
02:05:40,250 --> 02:05:42,519
Here. Come here. Okay.

1527
02:05:42,552 --> 02:05:44,521
Okay. Go that way.
