1
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:34,864
Lots of love!

2
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,544
What? You little mutt!

3
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,179
- Come back here!
- Oh!

4
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:59,382
Bring back my gyros!

5
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,115
Hey, watch it!

6
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:02,216
Excuse me.

7
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:03,517
Pardon me. Whoa!

8
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:05,252
- Hey! Bone-headed pooch!
- Sorry!

9
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,288
Ruh-roh!

10
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:10,757
Dispatch, I've got a stray dog
on a tube of compressed meat.

11
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:15,562
Repeat. I have
a grand theft gyro in progress.

12
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:17,763
Hey, slow it down!

13
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:20,599
Huh?

14
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,768
Yikes. Whoa!

15
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:25,536
Hey!

16
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:35,979
Zoinks!

17
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,249
Like, slow down, dude.

18
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,523

<i>Welcome to another episode

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,444
Friends, Who Needs Them?
You Do.

00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:13,278
<i>This week's challenge,

26

Excuse me!

30

Coming through!

31
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,257
Dude!

32
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:31,127
Whew!

33
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:33,663
Huh?

34
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,600
Make friends. Check.

35
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:44,972
Nice to meet you,
Shelly and Sandy.

36
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:48,976
How was your day?

37
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:53,347
Oh, you want me to start?
How polite, Sandy.

38
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:57,250
Well, I told my mom I was
meeting my pals at the beach.

39
00:02:57,318 --> 00:02:58,585
So, if she asks,

40
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,354
this technically counts
as a playdate.

41
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:05,525
But it's all good.
I like eating lunch by myself.

42
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,892
And hanging out by myself.

43
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,130
And playing ping-pong
by myself.

44
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:15,033
I lose a lot of balls.

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,738
Ahh!

46
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:36,785
I gotta warn you,

47
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:38,120
it's got gummy worms,

48
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,388
tater tots,
and ketchup leather.

49
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:41,655
Hmm.

50
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,624
I know. No liverwurst.

51
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,726
It's not like me
to forget the protein.

52
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:52,299
Yeah, I get it.
Nobody likes my sandwiches.

53
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,702
Whoa!

54
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,048
Mm. Is that peppercorn?

55
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:13,584
Sand.

56
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,252
- There you are!
- Ahh!

57
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,821
This mangy stray's
done enough damage for today.

58
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,256
He's coming with me.

59
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:20,656
He's not a stray.

60
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:22,191
Is he your dog?

61
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:25,261
He is, like, totally mine.
If you wanna be.

62
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:26,996
I'd like that very much.

63
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:30,098
Okay, then. What's his name?

64
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:31,367
I don't have one.

65
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,934
His name's...

66
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:37,037
- Snacks.
- What?

67
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:38,272
Snacks?

68
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,074
Uh, I mean... Scooby!

69
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,644
Middle name?

70
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:43,809
Dooby?

71
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:45,077
Last name.

72
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,281
Doo.

73
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:51,318
All right.
If the dog has a middle name,

74
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,785
there's no punishment
for damages or theft.

75
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:56,289
I don't like it,
but them's the laws.

76
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:59,358
Well, have a good day, sir.
Mr. Dooby-Doo.

77
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:07,465
I'm Norville,
but everyone calls me Shaggy.

78
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:08,632
Raggy.

79
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:10,934
No, it's Shaggy.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,770
That's what I said. Raggy.

81
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:15,138
We'll work on it.

82
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,177
Shaggy, you and your
new friend better hurry up

83
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:23,613
if you want to trick-or-treat.

84
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,046
Yay! Okay, Mom.

85
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:27,649
Let me show you my room.

86
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:29,784
I mean, our room.

87
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:41,927
Who's that?

88
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:46,198
This is Blue Falcon.
He's half-man, half-falcon.

89
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,267
Well, mostly man. All man.

90
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:51,637
I guess it's just the suit
that's falcon.

91
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:54,373
And his wonder dog sidekick,
Dynomutt.

92
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,675
Like, they solve crimes
and save the world together.

93
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,610
Cool.

94
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:00,712
Ooh!

95
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,012
What's this?

96
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,514
- It's a bed. You sleep in it.
- Huh.

97
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,153
Soft. I've never had
a bed before.

98
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,957
In fact, I've never had
anything before.

99
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:18,661
I, uh...

100
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:22,263
I ran out this afternoon
and I got something for you.

101
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,365
I know we just met

102
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:25,300
and I didn't wanna
seem too desperate

103
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:28,968
or, you know,
come on too strong, but...

104
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:36,342
I love it.

105
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:43,283
I promise
I'll never take it off.

106
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:51,689
Thanks.

107
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,391
Thank you!

108
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,693
Trick or treat!

109
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,128
I love Halloween!

110
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:00,630
And may I say,

111
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:02,831
you sure look good
in that costume.

112
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:05,769
Ranks, Raggy.
It's all in the hips.

113
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,935
Whoa! Jackpot!

114
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:11,205
Big house, big candy.

115
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:13,742
Like, no way, bro.
That's the Rigby house.

116
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,976
It's haunted.
Let's get outta here!

117
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,779
Mine!

118
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:18,945
Hey!

119
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,315
Give it back!

120
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,550
Yeah! We worked hard
for that free candy.

121
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:24,318
This stuff will rot your teeth.

122
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:26,919
Yeah. Don't you know Halloween
is just a marketing ploy

123
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:28,689
by Big Corn Syrup?

124
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,557
Yeah, we're okay with that.

125
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:34,427
Ruh-roh.

126
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:39,030
Your blood sugar
will thank us.

127
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,303
Are you guys all right?

128
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:48,871
Yeah.

129
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:52,041
They just hurt my pride.
And my tail feathers.

130
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:53,377
Let me give you a hand.

131
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:58,013
I'm Fred.

132
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,147
- This is Velma.
- Hi.

133
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:00,916
- And that's Daphne.
- Hey.

134
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,453
I'm Shaggy.
And this is Scooby-Doo.

135
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:05,219
Nice to meet you.

136
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,223
Cool Wonder Woman costume.

137
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,727
And are you... Harry Potter?

138
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,962
I'm Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
obviously.

139
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,699
Which house is she in?
Hufflepuff?

140
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,866
She's a Supreme Court justice.

141
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,901
Oh. Slytherin.

142
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,571
Come on.
Let's go get your candy back.

143
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,539
Wait,
that's the Rigby house.

144
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,307
It's haunted by a ghost.

145
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,874
Ghost?

146
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:32,043
Ghost or no ghost,
it's Halloween.

147
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,878
No one should go home
without their candy.

148
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:35,513
Uh... Okay.

149
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,548
We'll go in the haunted house
this one time,

150
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:39,650
but we're not gonna make
a habit out of this.

151
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:40,752
Right, Scoob?

152
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,052
Right.

153
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,196
Hello?

154
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:57,932
Anybody home?

155
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,968
This living room feels more
like a dying room.

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,007
Here you go, Shaggy.

157
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,343
Great.
Thanks a bunch. Let's go.

158
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:14,914
It's the ghost!

159
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:17,683
Guys, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

160
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:26,591
Hmm.

161
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,660
Uh...

162
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,429
Girl dressed like Judge Judy,

163
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,730
I don't think
this is a good idea.

164
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,036
Huh?

165
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:52,448
- The ghost!
- Go get help!

166
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:55,284
Aah!

167
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:04,925
Come on, hurry!

168
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,959
Guys, we gotta do something.

169
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,197
- Quick, upstairs!
- Come on, let's go!

170
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:14,934
Daphne!

171
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,335
Whoa!

172
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:17,736
Run, Daphne, run!

173
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:29,713
Fred, look!

174
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,587
Uh-oh.

175
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,087
Velma!

176
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:40,590
Got it.

177
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,792
Hey! What are you... Oh.

178
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,362
Oh.

179
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:48,330
Huh?

180
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:50,231
Gotcha.

181
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:52,065
Jeepers.

182
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,835
It's a Halloween mask.

183
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:56,470
Mr. Rigby!

184
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,306
Uh, guys?

185
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,276
I think we just found
the world's smallest Walmart.

186
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:09,180
Man, this guy
stole a lot of stuff!

187
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:10,415
Bag it all up, Frank.

188
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:12,751
He's going away
for a long time.

189
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:20,291
I would've
gotten away with this

190
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,727
if it weren't for you
meddling...

191
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:26,195
Congratulations, everyone.

192
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:28,230
We just proved
this house wasn't haunted,

193
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:29,566
and busted a perp.

194
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,233
And even better,
we got our candy back.

195
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:34,135
Not bad for a bunch of kids.

196
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:35,971
Maybe we should do this again.

197
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:37,940
- I like it.
- I'm in.

198
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,207
What do you say, guys?

199
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,243
We're in.

200
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,747
I mean, like, how many
scary monsters could there be?

All right, everybody.

221
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,765
I would like to pose to you all

222
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,500
the question of questions.

223
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,236
What's next for Mystery Inc.?

224
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,472
Ooh, I totally have
the answer. Lunch.

225
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,874
No, Shaggy, I think
what Fred means is that...

226
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,610
I was also gonna say lunch.

227
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,777
Guys, guys, guys.

228
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,980
The Mystery Machine
needs a whole new...

229
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,348
Needs a whole new everything,

230
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:05,350
and I'm never gonna
get that smell out.

231
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,618
I told you I needed a walk.

232
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:10,654
It's time to turn Mystery Inc.
into a real business.

233
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:13,122
What do you mean?
Like, carry a briefcase,

234
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:16,191
and wear a tie, and pay taxes?

235
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:17,860
Wait, have you not been
paying your taxes?

236
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,528
I handle our accounting.

237
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,731
Look, we're ready
to take on bigger cases,

238
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:24,099
scarier villains,
and creepier mysteries,

239
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,233
but that takes money.

240
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,768
Fortunately,

241
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,135
we found a possible investor.

242
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:30,372
Oh, whoopee, a diner.

243
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:33,340
I'll have a napkin
and some hand sanitizer.

244
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:37,077
Whoa, man! It's Simon Cowell.

245
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:44,117

246
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:48,587

248
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:56,227
Uh, congratulations, gentlemen.

249
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,396
You are terrible.

250
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,231
How does he do that?
See, he's mean,

251
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,866
but he makes it fun.

252
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:04,434
We appreciate your interest
in Mystery Inc., Mr. Cowell.

253
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:05,769
Every successful group

254
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:08,738
requires hard work
and determination.

255
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:13,174
Identifying potential is what
I do, and you have got it.

256
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:15,411
Fred, you're the tank.
The muscle.

257
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:16,645
- Cool.
- Daphne is

258
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:18,547
the people person. The empath.

259
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:21,015
- Aw.
- And Velma's got the smarts

260
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:23,251
- and technical savvy.
- Thanks.

261
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:24,852
But you two
aren't even listening.

262
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:28,488
You're eating a clownishly
oversized sandwich.

263
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:30,557
Like, sorry, man.

264
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,726
You lost us at,
"Hard work and determination."

265
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,928
But you got us back
at "sandwich."

266
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:38,631
Look, a group can only be as
strong as its weakest links.

267
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:41,567
Bottom line, I can't invest
with these two involved.

268
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:45,036
But, Mr. Cowell, Shaggy and
Scooby are our best friends.

269
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:48,273
Yeah, and like, what's more
valuable than friendship?

270
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,308
Literally, anything.

271
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,577
You can't count on friendship.
People change.

272
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,312
And when you get
into real trouble,

273
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,948
friendship won't save the day.

274
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:01,250
Like, we don't need this,
Scoob. Let's bounce.

275
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,886
Yeah, we know
when we're not wanted.

276
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,054
No.

277
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,389
- Ugh. Wait.
- Come on, guys.

278
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:07,856
He didn't mean it.

279
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,961
No fries for you. Hmm!

280
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:28,074
You believe
the nerve of that dude?

281
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:31,543
Simon Cowell thinks friendship
won't save the day.

282
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,612
What does he know?

283
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,551
Yeah, he's not that smart.
Just sounds like it,

284
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:42,820
because he's British.

285
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:44,322
Good point, Raggy.

286
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:47,624
As long as we have each other,
we'll be just fine on our own.

287
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,359
Right.

288
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:57,566
Yes!

289
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:03,938
Eyes?

290
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,573
Raggy, look.

291
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,377
- Huh?
- The pin. It has eyes.

292
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,085
Oh, Scoob,

293
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:21,053
I know it feels like
everyone's judging us today.

294
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,555
Even the bowling pins.

295
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:24,457
But don't freak out on me, bud.

296
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,126
Uh...

297
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:29,494
What's the hold-up?

298
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,863
The ball return
won't return our ball.

299
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,738
Huh.

300
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:50,947
Oh, there it is.

301
00:16:52,314 --> 00:16:53,949
Zoinks!

302
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,084
Like, what is going on?

303
00:16:58,353 --> 00:16:59,854
What are those things?

304
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,889
I don't know,
but they don't look friendly.

305
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:06,460
No offense, but I think

306
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,695
I liked you better
as a bowling ball.

307
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:09,863
Me, too.

308
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,100
Look out!

309
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,335
Whoa!

310
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,541
No running.

311
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:25,643
They're coming.

312
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,483
- What now?
- Follow my lead.

313
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:35,619
Who's hungry?

314
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:37,521
Check out the specials.

315
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:41,157
So, like, what are you guys
in the mood to eat?

316
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,925
And please don't say human.

317
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:43,960
Or dog.

318
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,799
Okay, Bowling Alley Yakitori.

319
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:53,401
And how about you guys?
Hot wings to share?

320
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:54,369
Uh-huh.

321
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:56,837
Got it. And for you?

322
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:01,141
Oh, no! We're out of calamari.

323
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:08,249
This way, Scoob!

324
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,423
Huh, I always wondered
what was back here.

325
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,658
Underwhelming.

326
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:28,164
<i>All units.</i>

327
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,166
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

328
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,670
<i>We have a 4-1-5 in progress
at the Takamoto Bowl.</i>

329
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,005
"Tiny violent
shape-shifting robots

330
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,506
chasing a man and a dog

331
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:40,142
in a bowling alley,
linen store or car wash."

332
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,444
Wow, the police really do have
a code for everything.

333
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:43,811
The Takamoto Bowl?

334
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:45,413
That's where
Scoob and Shaggy hang out.

335
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,249
Oh, no.

336
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:48,516
Let's go.

337
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:56,456
Did we lose 'em?

338
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,125
Pretty sure we didn't.

339
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,574
Yikes!

340
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,683
Looks like this is goodbye,
old buddy.

341
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,551
We never saw Paris.

342
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:31,920
Huh?

343
00:19:57,743 --> 00:20:01,513
Oh, man,
dig that crazy elevator.

344
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,981
You okay, Scooby-Doo?

345
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:05,116
Yeah. I'm good.

346
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:08,920
Whew. Where are we?

347
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:20,364
Dude, hang on.

348
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,299
Do you realize where we are?

349
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,166
- No.
- Look around, man.

350
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:25,768
The clean, modern aesthetic.

351
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:27,769
The cool blue color palette.

352
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:28,803
- We're in...
- IKEA!

353
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,505
...the <i>Falcon Fury!</i>

354
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:31,840
Did you say IKEA?

355
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:34,576
Nope. I said <i>Falcon Fury.</i>
Just like you.

356
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,179
Gentlemen, welcome aboard.

357
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:41,815
I'm Dee Dee Skyes,
pilot of the <i>Falcon Fury.</i>

358
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:43,417
- Well, we're Scoob...
- Scooby and Shaggy.

359
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:44,884
We know. Follow me.

360
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,886
Who sent those robots?

361
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,821
It's this guy named
Dick Dastardly.

362
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:50,956
Shocker!
He's a psychotic supervillain.

363
00:20:51,023 --> 00:20:53,091
He's trying to
you.

364
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:56,862
Scoob, somebody thinks we're
important enough to...

365
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:59,130
It's nice to be wanted.

366
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:00,598
Mm, I hear that.

367
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:07,371
Oh, wow!

368
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:08,872
- Look! Look!
- Wow.

369
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:11,141
Yes, I know
it's super cool in here,

370
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,310
and I would totally let you
guys press random buttons,

371
00:21:13,377 --> 00:21:14,743
but they told me
we need to move.

372
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:18,448
Seriously?
We're doing this now?

373
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:20,115
Ooh. Is it him? Is it him?

374
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:22,984
Yep. He likes to make
an entrance.

375
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,153
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

376
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,988
<i>since the dawn of time...</i>

377
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:28,756
<i>...the falcon
has been worshipped</i>

378
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:31,725
<i>as a symbol
of freedom and victory.</i>

379
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:33,261
<i>Now,</i>

380
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,497
<i>a new kind of falcon
rules the sky.</i>

381
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:41,535
<i>And he is one bad mamma jamma.</i>

382
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,868
Blue Falcon!

383
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,307
Ooh, yeah!

384
00:21:57,248 --> 00:22:00,185
Welcome to the <i>Falcon Fury.</i>

385
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:04,421
Hang on, hang on.

386
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,855
Turn on the lights.

387
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:06,923
Where are my balloons, Dee Dee?

388
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:08,258
When I say <i>"Falcon Fury,"</i>

389
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:10,093
that's supposed
to cue the balloons.

390
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,060
Keith, what is the deal
up there, man?

391
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:13,595
<i>I missed the cue.</i>

392
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:16,466
Duh. You've got one job, pal.
Anyway,

393
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:18,600
welcome aboard,
I'm Blue Falcon.

394
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,634
No, you're not.

395
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:22,270
Yes, I am.

396
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:24,071
I told you I wasn't going to
be the only one who noticed.

397
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:26,739
No, Blue Falcon's suit
has a bigger red "F"

398
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:29,376
on the chest,
and it's way less, uh, scaly.

399
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:31,945
They're feathers, all right?
And it's called an upgrade.

400
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:33,780
This ain't
your daddy's Blue Falcon.

401
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:36,849
I think you mean this ain't
your daddy's Blue Falcon.

402
00:22:36,915 --> 00:22:38,684
Allow me to introduce you

403
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,255
to Blue Falcon's
large adult son, Brian.

404
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,456
Dynomutt!

405
00:22:44,523 --> 00:22:45,890
Oh, him you recognize?

406
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:48,960
Well, sure, man!
Dynomutt is the dog wonder.

407
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:51,761
Blue Falcon doesn't go
anywhere without him.

408
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,299
And yet here I am. Without him.

409
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:56,666
Ow! What was that for?

410
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:58,236
Making sure this isn't a dream.

411
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,337
You're supposed
to pinch yourself.

412
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:02,572
- Ow!
- Ow!

413
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:04,274
- Oh!
- Ow!

414
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,674
Ow.

415
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:08,210
Finished?

416
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:09,178
- Ow!
- Yes.

417
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,247
- Wait, Brian...
- Blue Falcon.

418
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:13,915
- If you're Blue Falcon now...
- I am.

419
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:15,517
- Does that mean...
- Yes.

420
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:19,187
Regretfully, my father has
moved on to a better place.

421
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:21,822
Oh, no!

422
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,459
What? Oh, no, he's not dead.
He retired to Palm Beach.

423
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:28,761
We still miss him
very, very, very,

424
00:23:28,828 --> 00:23:30,862
- very, very...
- Oh, no, he's glitching.

425
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:31,897
No, I'm not. Let me finish.

426
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:35,368
...very, very, very much.

427
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:38,437
It's Dastardly.

428
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,037
He must have tracked you here
from the bowling alley.

429
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:41,939
Let's move it, people.
To the Falcon Nest.

430
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,774
Like, hey, wait up!

431
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:53,617
Nobody gets away
from Dick Dastardly.

432
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:54,850
Right, Rottens?

433
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:59,688
I need what's on that ship,
or I'll never get my treasure.

434
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:02,591
Do not fail me.

435
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:10,499
Dee Dee, take the helm.

436
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:12,132
Ready, sir.

437
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,268
You might want to buckle up.

438
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:16,537
And if you get sick,
puke on Brian.

439
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:17,804
Punch it, Dee Dee.

440
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:20,207
Hang on.

441
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,777
- Zoinks!
- What's this guy's deal?

442
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:26,513
Look, the hot goss
on my fan site

443
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:27,745
is that Dastardly's collecting

444
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:29,215
the three shells
of Seabiscuit...

445
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:32,618
It's skulls of Cerberus,
Brian. We went over this.

446
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:34,286
He's got one skull.

447
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,119
Our mission is to make sure
he doesn't get the other two.

448
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:38,989
Like, what do those creepy
skulls have to do with us?

449
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:40,291
No idea.

450
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,428
Hold tight.

451
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:56,938
- I can't shake him.
- Try the shake button.

452
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,673
Ooh, I'll take
a chocolate shake.

453
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:00,242
Vanilla, please.

454
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:02,410
- There is no shake button.
- Well, there should be.

455
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:06,779
All right, Rottens.
Launch the harpoons.

456
00:25:10,684 --> 00:25:12,785
Incoming!

457
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,953
What is going on?

458
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:24,596
Well done. Reel them in.

459
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:27,232
Dynomutt, can you reverse the
polarity of the tractor beam?

460
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,600
Of course,
but that would make...

461
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,269
- Reverse on my mark.
- On it.

462
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,770
Now!

463
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,241
Why have we stopped pulling
in that ship?

464
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,278
Oh, no, no, no. No, no. No!

465
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:54,489
Argh! Drat!

466
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,362
Whew. Are you guys okay?

467
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,797
Yeah, but, like, if you want,

468
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:07,434
you can pull over
and drop us off here.

469
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:11,404
We'll walk home.

470
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,938
Dastardly could have
finished us if he wanted to.

471
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,874
I think he wants
you guys alive.

472
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,576
I knew you two were important.

473
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,412
It would be safer for you if
you joined us on our mission.

474
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,812
It would?

475
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:25,417
Ring, ring! Ring, ring!
Ring, ring!

476
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,417
Ring, ring!

477
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:28,419
Boop! Hello? Oh!

478
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:29,753
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

479
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:31,221
Well, of course.

480
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,823
Uh, guys, adventure's calling,
and it's for you.

481
00:26:36,392 --> 00:26:37,627
Hello, adventure.

482
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:40,263
Yes, will you take my name
and number off your list?

483
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:44,031
But, Raggy, this is our chance.

484
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:45,400
Yeah, maybe you're right.

485
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,968
We can show everyone
we're not the weak link.

486
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,970
Uh, Mr. Adventure, sir,
it's me again.

487
00:26:51,037 --> 00:26:53,174
Uh, my partner is intrigued
by your offer,

488
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,508
but I'm still on the fence.

489
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:56,477
We're gonna have
to call you back. Bye-bye.

490
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:00,447
Click.

491
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:02,349
- You really wanna do this?
- Uh-huh.

492
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:04,451
Well, I'm not gonna
let you do it without me.

493
00:27:04,517 --> 00:27:07,952
After all, there is no "I"
in Scooby and Shaggy.

494
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:09,555
Wait, is there?

495
00:27:09,621 --> 00:27:10,955
No, all good.

496
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:12,056
We're in.

497
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:13,592
That's what I'm talking about!

498
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:15,760
Now, I've got a few waivers
for you guys to sign.

499
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,365
Oh, great. Great timing, Keith.

500
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,166
<i>Thank you!</i>

501
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:24,201
Well, uh,
the robots attacked

502
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,136
this talking dog
and a gangly dude

503
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:28,839
that had this habit
of using the word "like"

504
00:27:28,904 --> 00:27:30,140
at the start of every sentence.

505
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:31,807
Almost as if he was

506
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:35,211
some middle-aged man's idea
of how a teenage hippie talks.

507
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,446
Oh, that's Scoob and Shaggy
all right.

508
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:38,713
So, what happened?

509
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,782
I don't know.
They seemed pretty bummed out.

510
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:42,082
I guess their friends
dumped them

511
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,951
in a cold-hearted way
or something.

512
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:46,086
And then this blue light
came down from the sky

513
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:47,521
and beamed them up.

514
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:51,225
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Shaggy and Scooby were taken?

515
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,593
Yeah.

516
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,093
I'd have to assume that if
they were with their friends,

517
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:55,762
they wouldn't
have been kidnapped.,

518
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:57,663
I can't...

519
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,165
I can't breathe.

520
00:27:59,232 --> 00:28:01,234
Whoever those friends are

521
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,402
must be carrying a ton of guilt

522
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:05,437
on their shoulders
right about now.

523
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,239
Okay, can you skip
the emotional punishment

524
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:08,807
and describe the robots,
please?

525
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:11,642
Yeah, sure. Uh, they looked
like what's in this box.

526
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:12,909
Whoa!

527
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:16,580
Guys,
this thing is <i>increíble.</i>

528
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:18,882
It's fully autonomous
and capable of modifying

529
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,683
its external appearance.

530
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,353
I'd like to shake the hand
of whoever created this.

531
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:29,191
And then, you know,
throw that hand in prison

532
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:30,992
for trying to kill our friends.

533
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:32,761
Right? Am I right?

534
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:35,061
Ew! Is that... a hair?

535
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,935
Maybe this can lead us
to our culprit.

536
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:43,236
What are you doing?

537
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:44,970
You're touching it
with bare fingers.

538
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:46,206
Grow up, Fred.

539
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:47,774
Do you know
how many stray hairs

540
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:49,576
the average human eats
every day without knowing it?

541
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:51,075
If it's more than zero,
I don't wanna know.

542
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:53,945
It's more. Much, much more.

543
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:56,782
Huh. Trace amounts
of mustache oil.

544
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:58,150
12-year-old Scotch.

545
00:28:58,217 --> 00:29:00,785
Ugh. Is the bad guy my dad?

546
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:03,521
There are also some
microscopic soil particles.

547
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:07,157
Composition is a mix
of arsenic, selenium and...

548
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:08,926
Coppertone SPF 50.

549
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:10,727
Anything over 30 is a waste.

550
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:12,496
I'll see if the combination
of these elements

551
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:14,564
matches
a geographical location.

552
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:17,032
And...

553
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:20,169
Bingo. Dastardly Demolition.

554
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,237
Per county records,

555
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,972
last known owner is...
Dick Dastardly.

556
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,109
What would a creep like that
want with Scooby and Shaggy?

557
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:29,511
Hmm. Well, let's see what

558
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:31,812
the police department database
has to say.

559
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:33,481
Ooh. Quite a rap sheet.

560
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:35,182
It looks like
he's wanted for the theft

561
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:38,351
of archeological artifacts
from a dig in Peru.

562
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:41,187
<i>Tatty bye.</i>

563
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:43,456
That looks like
a giant dog skull.

564
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:44,324
Weird.

565
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,558
It gets weirder. He also stole

566
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:47,793
the genealogical records

567
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,128
of a dozen dogs
from the Global Kennel Club.

568
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:51,897
And apparently
he's been stealing Netflix

569
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,198
by using his mother's account.

570
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:54,866
That is not fair

571
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:57,168
for the rest of us
who have to pay for Netflix.

572
00:29:57,235 --> 00:29:58,936
You have to pay for Netflix?

573
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:00,471
This will not stand.

574
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:03,206
Let's go get
that Dastardly dude.

575
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:24,726
I just needed you
to retrieve one simple canine,

576
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,494
so I could get my treasure.

577
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:30,864
Now, were the missions
a failure?

578
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:36,102
Pinhead.
The question was rhetorical.

579
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,370
Of course it was a failure

580
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:40,071
because you failed me.

581
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:43,008
You are responsible
for my suffering.

582
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,715
Oh, sorry. You're sorry?
You certainly are.

583
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:54,218
And I thought my last sidekick
was worthless.

584
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,320
At least he had a backbone.

585
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:01,591
And fur and a wet nose.

586
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:04,327
But you, whoa-ho-ho,
you've lowered the bar

587
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:06,228
to new depths
of craven ineptitude

588
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:07,996
I didn't even think
were possible.

589
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:12,768
That's not a compliment,
you aluminum imbecile!

590
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,268
You're not a partner,

591
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:16,237
you're a disgrace, a lemming,

592
00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:18,172
a boot-licking...

593
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,375
...suck-up.

594
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:24,644
An example must be made.

595
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:27,614
I want you to know
this is going to hurt me

596
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:29,816
a lot more than
it's going to hurt you.

597
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:33,252
No, not really.

598
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:37,690
Let this be a lesson
to you all.

599
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:40,692
If you're going to be
a sniveling suck-face...

600
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,394
...you're going
to look the part.

601
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:50,200
Forget you mechanical morons.
I'll fetch the key myself.

602
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:01,410
To find the second skull,
I'm searching

603
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:03,912
every possible location
with high fossil density.

604
00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:06,081
Brian! Quit putting filters
on your selfies

605
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:07,449
and get in the game.

606
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:09,085
Whoa, whoa,
what do you think I'm doing?

607
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,819
I'm putting my social media
feelers out there, Dynobutt.

608
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:13,354
Found it!

609
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,355
The second skull?

610
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:15,889
No. Even better.

611
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:17,524
The Falcon Fridge.

612
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:21,227
FYI, you are
officially out of...

613
00:32:21,294 --> 00:32:23,329
everything.

614
00:32:23,396 --> 00:32:24,998
Yes! I love these guys.

615
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:27,332
I'm busting my tail
to save the world for him,

616
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,369
and he loves the guys
who brought treats.

617
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:33,805
Prepare your taste buds
for a Scoob-Shag specialty.

618
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:41,646
Whoa, whoa. You put jalapeño
peppers on your ice cream?

619
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:42,512
Heat and sweet.

620
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:44,381
It's our signature dessert.

621
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:45,615
Heat signature!

622
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:48,018
That's it!
You guys are geniuses!

623
00:32:48,085 --> 00:32:50,120
We're geniuses.

624
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,588
Take that, Simon Cowell.

625
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:54,223
The supernatural energy
in that skull

626
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:56,425
would give off
a specific heat signature.

627
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:58,826
All we gotta do
is locate that spot.

628
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:02,296
Boom! The skull
is in the Gobi Desert.

629
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,631
Incorrect.

630
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:05,233
I just found out
where the skull is,

631
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:06,967
and it's not
in the Gobi Desert.

632
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:08,301
It's in Romania.

633
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:09,803
Like, how do you know?

634
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,805
A hero never reveals
his secrets.

635
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:13,774
I believe you're thinking
of magicians.

636
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,474
I'm always thinking
of magicians.

637
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,043
But if you must know,

638
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,578
I got a DM from one of my fans
who gave me the locayshe.

639
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:21,313
Brian, those are a lot of words

640
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,115
no one your age
should be using.

641
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:25,684
Sir, this could be a trap
set by Dastardly.

642
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,054
If it was a trap, why would
Anonymous use his own name?

643
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:34,558
Wait, do you think "Anonymous"
is the name of a person?

644
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,894
Well, based on your tone
of voice, I don't any more.

645
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,130
Sir, we really should go
to the Gobi Desert.

646
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:42,298
I hear you.
You make a valid point,

647
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:44,000
but we're gonna do
my thing, okay?

648
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:45,702
To the Falcon Nest.

649
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,769
Brian, last time you listened
to someone on the Internet,

650
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:51,673
you thought Tinder was an app
that delivers firewood.

651
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,275
Velma, what do you got?

652
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:55,209
I built a sequencing program
to cross-match

653
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:56,577
the biographical data

654
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:58,146
that Dastardly stole
from the canine registry

655
00:33:58,212 --> 00:33:59,081
against Scooby-Doo.

656
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:00,548
Good thing I'm the tank,

657
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,282
because I could
not do any of that.

658
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:03,683
Any leads?

659
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,785
All the dogs, and Scooby,
seem to be related.

660
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:07,121
Jeepers.

661
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:09,988
If I take Dastardly's work
and follow the trail...

662
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:15,994
Whoa! Scooby-Doo is the last
descendant of Peritas?

663
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:17,229
Who's Peritas?

664
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:18,963
He was
Alexander the Great's dog.

665
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,933
Okay, so, Scooby is related
to some ancient dog.

666
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:23,968
- So, what does that mean?
- I have no idea.

667
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:26,603
Guys, this is our
most important mystery ever.

668
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,372
Yeah. This isn't about
some guy in a rubber mask.

669
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,774
It's about one of us.

670
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:32,943
Fred, how much longer
to Dastardly Demolition?

671
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:34,144
I know a shortcut.

672
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,902
Hustle, you two!
We haven't got all day!

673
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,438
Second thoughts?

674
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:10,008
Honestly, buddy,
I'm on my 4th or 5th thoughts.

675
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:22,986
Oh, man.

676
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:26,723
This amusement park
isn't very amusing!

677
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:29,392
According to Anonymous,

678
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:32,327
the second skull
should be right here.

679
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:41,803
Hey! Did Dastardly get
the anonymous tip, too?

680
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:46,406
You dim-witted do-gooders!

681
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:48,642
I've already retrieved
the second skull

682
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,844
from the Gobi Desert.

683
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:54,413
Gobi Desert? Hmm. Where have I
heard that before?

684
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,483
Oh, right, me.

685
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,085
Okay, Brian,
we've had our differences,

686
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:01,353
but this is the moment
where we stand together and...

687
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,487
Run!

688
00:36:04,022 --> 00:36:05,390
Classic Brian.

689
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:09,027
Dee Dee, you cover
Scooby and Shaggy.

690
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:10,394
I'll run interference.

691
00:36:25,898 --> 00:36:28,501
Stop right there,
you filthy animal.

692
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:30,036
And your dog, too.

693
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:31,237
This way!

694
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,097
Aw.

695
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:08,403
Weak link, my butt.

696
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,911
Whoa, dude!
What do you want with us?

697
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:21,148
I don't care about you.

698
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:22,849
You're not remotely important.

699
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:24,417
It's the dog I need.

700
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:27,553
Raggy!

701
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,623
Stay! Sit! Heel!
Did nobody train this thing?

702
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:38,996
Oh, hey.

703
00:37:39,062 --> 00:37:40,364
Look, I know it looks like
I'm hiding,

704
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:42,667
but this is actually
a superior vantage point!

705
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:46,002
Whoa!

706
00:38:02,684 --> 00:38:04,518
Scooby-Dooby-Doo?

707
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:08,222
Where are you?

708
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:10,691
Come on now. Don't be scared.

709
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:13,828
I love dogs.

710
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:17,130
I had a dog myself once.
He was an ill-tempered brute

711
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:18,631
with a ghastly underbite,

712
00:38:18,698 --> 00:38:21,868
who stunk and caused me
endless headaches.

713
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,001
He's lost now.

714
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,671
Is he chipped?

715
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:26,037
Forget about him.

716
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,039
It's all about you.

717
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,175
You, my friend, are special.

718
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,478
You see, within you lies a key.

719
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:37,949
What... I don't have your key.
No pockets.

720
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:39,951
No. You are the key.

721
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:43,653
Join me, Scooby-Doo,

722
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,790
and I will show you
how to harness your destiny

723
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,559
and become the most
important dog in the world.

724
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,360
No, thanks, Dastardly.

725
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:55,230
Oh, please.
My friends call me...

726
00:38:56,097 --> 00:38:56,998
Dick.

727
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:59,199
Rokay, Rick.

728
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:02,770
No, I'm not a Rick.
I'm a Dick. With a D.

729
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:04,238
Rick. With a D.

730
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:06,773
D-D-D-Dick!

731
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,976
R-R-R-Rick.

732
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,376
Dick, Dick,

733
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:11,778
Dick!

734
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:16,716
Drat.

735
00:39:19,217 --> 00:39:21,086
Brian! Do something!

736
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:25,089
- Like what?
- Like drop some F-bombs.

737
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,124
Hey, man, whoa,
let's keep it PG.

738
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:30,260
No. Falcon bombs!

739
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,328
You know, my utility belt
has so many little pouches.

740
00:39:32,395 --> 00:39:34,698
- They're right there!
- Ah!

741
00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:36,299
12 trillion volts, brother.

742
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:38,635
- You wanna throw it?
- Do I ever!

743
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,205
F-bombs away!

744
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:09,828
Here, boy! Where are you?

745
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:17,769
You're mine, Scooby-Doo!

746
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:19,637
Sit.

747
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:20,437
Good boy.

748
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:23,273
You can start screaming...

749
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,475
now.

750
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:28,177
Follow that dog.

751
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:37,853
- Brian!
- Raggy!

752
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,122
Whoo-hoo!

753
00:40:47,394 --> 00:40:48,563
I hate the loops.

754
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,398
Give me that dog!

755
00:40:52,465 --> 00:40:54,200
- Raggy!
- Scooby!

756
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:56,302
Everybody say,
"Hashtag foxy Falcon."

757
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:58,037
Hashtag foxy Falcon!

758
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:07,879
Drat!

759
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,951
Not again.

760
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,088
Dastardly will be back.

761
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:18,990
Please tell me
you got some leads.

762
00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:22,157
Dastardly said I was the key.

763
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:24,393
- The key to what?
- Ah-ha!

764
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,195
- I knew this guy was special!
- Why?

765
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:27,831
Because the bad guy said so?

766
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:30,465
Exactly! What did Dastardly
say about you?

767
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,434
Well, I believe
his exact words were, uh,

768
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:34,870
"I don't care about you.

769
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:36,437
You're not remotely important."

770
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:38,505
And, "It's the dog I need."

771
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:39,574
Harsh.

772
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:40,842
And then he shot me
through the wall.

773
00:41:40,908 --> 00:41:42,076
Really harsh.

774
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:43,377
But, on the bright side,

775
00:41:43,443 --> 00:41:45,712
your friend is super important.

776
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:47,581
Now let's get
that dog a hero suit!

777
00:41:47,648 --> 00:41:49,583
- Huh?
- Shouldn't we be focusing

778
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,885
on finding that third skull
before Dastardly?

779
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:53,953
Or why Scooby is so important?

780
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,487
- It could be a clue to...
- Details.

781
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,189
All right, first things first.
Come on, Scooby-Doo!

782
00:41:58,256 --> 00:41:59,692
- Cool.
- Uh...

783
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:01,525
Right behind you, Scoob.

784
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:08,232
Drat, drat, and double drat!

785
00:42:08,298 --> 00:42:10,768
What is it?

786
00:42:12,502 --> 00:42:17,640
Scooby-Doo's friends.
How perfect.

787
00:42:17,707 --> 00:42:19,575
Send me
their location immediately.

788
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:42,494
Oh!

789
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:44,097
Huh?

790
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,633
- Like, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

791
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,267
Oh, looks like
that old collar's in the way

792
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,535
of the chest panel.

793
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,953
Huh?

794
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,656
Hmm?

795
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:20,462
Whoa. Awesome!

796
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:22,296
What do you think, Raggy?

797
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,733
Looks great.

798
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:34,307
Hey.

799
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:35,576
Hey, man.

800
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:37,643
You're feeling left out.
I get it.

801
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,478
Totally natural
when two buddies realize

802
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:41,214
that one of them
is destined for greatness

803
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:43,348
and the other one
is destined for,

804
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:45,416
you know, other stuff.

805
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:48,019
Look, the point is,
I got you something, too.

806
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,021
Keith. Give it to me.

807
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:51,790
My Blue Falcon Confidence Pack.

808
00:43:51,857 --> 00:43:53,524
Retails for $99.95.

809
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,391
You got your
<i>Blue Falcon Nutrition Guide,</i>

810
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:56,660
Blue Falcon resistance bands,

811
00:43:56,727 --> 00:43:58,896
a copy of
my dad's autobiography,

812
00:43:58,963 --> 00:43:59,997
<i>No Falcon Around,</i>

813
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:01,931
and my light-hearted follow-up,

814
00:44:01,998 --> 00:44:03,332
<i>Just Falcon Around.</i>

815
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:04,901
Oh, thanks, man.

816
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:06,803
It means a lot
to hear that from you.

817
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,071
How do you mean?

818
00:44:08,138 --> 00:44:10,438
Well, you know, we both
struggle with confidence.

819
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:11,707
When Dastardly attacked,

820
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,341
we were both freaking out
and hiding.

821
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:15,611
Hey! It was
a superior vantage point!

822
00:44:15,677 --> 00:44:18,579
But, like, your father
was this great hero, right?

823
00:44:18,646 --> 00:44:20,848
So, like, you're expected
to be one, too,

824
00:44:20,915 --> 00:44:23,518
and those are big shoes
to fill.

825
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:24,919
I mean,
the pressure is monumental.

826
00:44:24,986 --> 00:44:26,553
Not to mention
the imposter's syndrome

827
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,054
that comes with the territory.

828
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:30,757
How do you breathe
under the weight of all that?

829
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,358
Uh...

830
00:44:43,568 --> 00:44:45,469
Dyno, what do you got?

831
00:44:45,537 --> 00:44:46,805
The signal's too weak.

832
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:48,606
I can't lock in
the exact coordinates.

833
00:44:48,673 --> 00:44:50,541
I'm gonna cross-check
the triangulation pattern.

834
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:52,375
Oh! Super cool.

835
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:54,211
Better than bowling, huh?

836
00:44:58,981 --> 00:44:59,882
Hurry, Fred!

837
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,416
Shaggy and Scooby
are in trouble

838
00:45:01,483 --> 00:45:02,985
and your shortcut
to Dastardly Demolition

839
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:04,319
is taking forever.

840
00:45:04,386 --> 00:45:05,587
Technically, this route

841
00:45:05,654 --> 00:45:07,122
is 73 meters longer
than the highway.

842
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:08,790
Meters, Velma?

843
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:10,292
I don't even know what that
means. What are we, in Europe?

844
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:16,197
It's a quantitatively superior
measurement system.

845
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:17,363
Get with the program, Fred.

846
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:18,532
Oh, you mean like your program?

847
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:20,701
"I'm Velma."

848
00:45:20,768 --> 00:45:22,836
"The world is ones and zeros."

849
00:45:22,902 --> 00:45:24,671
Maybe if you spent more
time reading books,

850
00:45:24,737 --> 00:45:26,906
- then...
- Guys! Stop.

851
00:45:26,973 --> 00:45:28,541
Why are we fighting?

852
00:45:30,374 --> 00:45:32,044
We didn't eat lunch!

853
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,712
We're just hangry.

854
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:35,881
Ever since
Shag and Scoob disappeared,

855
00:45:35,948 --> 00:45:37,182
there's been no one
to feed us

856
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:39,250
ridiculous sandwiches at lunch.

857
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:40,785
I miss them.

858
00:45:40,852 --> 00:45:42,720
Oh, me, too. Those little
pickles on top are the best.

859
00:45:42,787 --> 00:45:46,256
No! The guys,
not the sandwiches.

860
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:48,058
Aw, I miss them, too.

861
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:54,864
<i>Ready?</i>

862
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,497
<i>Ready!</i>

863
00:45:56,565 --> 00:45:58,033
<i>Okay, Shaggy,
take the picture.</i>

864
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,102
<i>Hurry up and take it.
This hurts my face.</i>

865
00:46:00,169 --> 00:46:02,604
<i>Shaggy,
you have it on video.</i>

866
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,404
<i>Oops!</i> <i>Sorry.</i>

867
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:09,810
Jinkies! Scooby and Shaggy
are with Blue Falcon?

868
00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:10,844
Of course.

869
00:46:10,911 --> 00:46:13,113
Blue light, beamed up.

870
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,447
That's the <i>Falcon Fury.</i>

871
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:15,949
How do you know so much
about superheroes

872
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:18,217
and so little
about the metric system?

873
00:46:18,284 --> 00:46:20,586
Because I'm an American man.

874
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,321
Oh, I'm so happy they're okay.

875
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:24,456
Oh, no.

876
00:46:24,523 --> 00:46:25,957
Pull over.

877
00:46:26,024 --> 00:46:26,958
Oh, boy.

878
00:46:34,598 --> 00:46:36,499
Okay, guys.
Let me do the talking.

879
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:39,270
I've seen <i>Cops</i>
at least six times.

880
00:46:39,336 --> 00:46:40,671
So, I know exactly what to say.

881
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:42,372
Good evening, Officer...

882
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:58,485
Fred, say something!

883
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,588
Hi.

884
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:03,257
Do you kids have any idea
how fast you were going?

885
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:07,193
Was it, uh, too fast?

886
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,629
Funny story, Officer.

887
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:12,165
We were rushing
to capture this evil villain

888
00:47:12,232 --> 00:47:14,733
who we thought was trying
to kill our friends.

889
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,236
Uh-huh.
Step out of the vehicle.

890
00:47:17,303 --> 00:47:19,538
All of you.

891
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:21,172
You've gotta
believe us, Officer.

892
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:23,074
This guy is really dangerous.

893
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:25,310
Ooh, dangerous.

894
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,611
Sounds like he's a...

895
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:28,546
handsome guy.

896
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:32,582
Oh, no, no.
Bulbous nose. Huge chin.

897
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:36,053
Yeah, but in a cool way,
like Gérard Depardieu.

898
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,486
No, in a super gross way.

899
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:41,924
Like a rat and a mound
of hair had a baby.

900
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:43,693
How dare you!

901
00:47:45,593 --> 00:47:47,162
Dick Dastardly!

902
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:49,998
I have so many mixed feelings.

903
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,067
How did you find us?

904
00:47:52,133 --> 00:47:55,402
Oh, let's just say
I had insider information.

905
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:09,348
You have the right
to remain silent.

906
00:48:10,782 --> 00:48:13,418
And everything you said
about my face...

907
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:18,155
...will be used against you
in a court of claw!

908
00:48:25,996 --> 00:48:27,063
Ah.

909
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,672
Mm.

910
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:39,375
Does this make
my ears look big?

911
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:41,209
Makes your ego
look big.

912
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:42,643
What did you say?

913
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,914
I said, uh, fine.
You look, uh, fine.

914
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:48,950
It sounded like you said "ego."

915
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:51,486
Nope. Must be in your head.

916
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:54,287
- Hmm.
- Your giant, inflated head.

917
00:48:54,354 --> 00:48:55,722
- What?
- Nothing.

918
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:57,857
Scooby! We need you!

919
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,800
As far as masks go,

920
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:11,202
I gotta say,
she was pretty hot.

921
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:12,804
Fred, focus.

922
00:49:12,871 --> 00:49:15,105
We've got to find a way
to contact Scooby and Shaggy.

923
00:49:15,172 --> 00:49:17,274
There goes the last bobby pin.

924
00:49:19,276 --> 00:49:21,044
Daphne, what are you doing?

925
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:23,112
If Scooby and Shaggy were here,

926
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:26,082
they would accidentally sit
on a rigged chair,

927
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:27,784
or bump their heads
against a wall

928
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,818
and it would open
a secret passage out of here.

929
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:32,821
They are surprisingly
effective goofballs.

930
00:49:32,888 --> 00:49:35,525
Whoa!

931
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,291
Ow.

932
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:43,631
Aw. Poor little thing.

933
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:45,999
Uh, Daph, he's not on our side.

934
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,135
Do you need help?

935
00:49:50,336 --> 00:49:52,739
It's okay. I want to help you.

936
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:04,282
Better?

937
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:12,055
Aw, you're welcome.

938
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:14,191
Hey, hey.

939
00:50:14,257 --> 00:50:17,026
Do you think you can help us
get out of here, little buddy?

940
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,874
Cool.

941
00:50:35,876 --> 00:50:39,680
Now, reveal
the final skull to me.

942
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,647
Your reunion is nigh!

943
00:50:41,714 --> 00:50:45,318
My heart's desire
is within reach!

944
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:56,728
Perfect. We have it!

945
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:59,663
Set a course
for Messick Mountain!

946
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,798
Messick Mountain?

947
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:02,199
We can't let him
get there first.

948
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:04,702
We have to warn Blue Falcon.

949
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:25,219
Huh? There's
a communications device.

950
00:51:26,287 --> 00:51:27,955
I'm gonna see
if I can find a backdoor

951
00:51:28,022 --> 00:51:30,257
into Blue Falcon's comms,

952
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:32,792
but I have no idea
what I'm patching into.

953
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:37,363
I've narrowed my search down
to 11 possible hot spots.

954
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:39,698
Oh. That one is a volcano.

955
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:41,433
Ten possible hot spots.

956
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:45,770
We need to search...

957
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:49,107
I suddenly feel funky.

958
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:51,309
- And I'm in.
- I've been hacked.

959
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,979
- Dynomutt!
- <i>Emergency.</i>

960
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,748
<i>Blue Falcon, come in,
Blue Falcon!</i>

961
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,283
I repeat, this is an emergency.

962
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,984
Stay out of
my search history.

963
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:03,352
<i>My name is Velma Dinkley.</i>

964
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:05,221
Who names their kid Velma?

965
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,889
<i>We are
prisoners of Dick Dastardly!</i>

966
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:08,424
Yikes! Where are you?

967
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:09,991
<i>I don't know,
but we're heading towards</i>

968
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:11,927
<i>a place
called Messick Mountain.</i>

969
00:52:11,993 --> 00:52:14,429
That's close to
a possible third hot spot!

970
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:17,364
That's it!

971
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:19,099
The skull must be
beneath the mountain!

972
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,502
That was unpleasant.

973
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:24,705
Hello? Hello?
Where are Scooby and Shaggy?

974
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:28,174
- Hello? Hello?
- Whoa!

975
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:30,410
- We lost the signal.
- Velma?

976
00:52:34,514 --> 00:52:35,481
Check it.

977
00:52:35,548 --> 00:52:37,916
That's a lock. But to where?

978
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,420
The Gates to the Underworld.

979
00:52:42,487 --> 00:52:43,888
It all makes sense now.

980
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:46,190
Oh, boy.
That's the serious face.

981
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:47,992
We always get in trouble
after that face.

982
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:50,961
Alexander the Great and
Peritas conquered the world

983
00:52:51,027 --> 00:52:53,664
and built the gates to protect
their enormous treasure.

984
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,098
That's where the lock comes in.

985
00:52:55,165 --> 00:52:58,434
Only Alexander or Peritas
can unlock it.

986
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:01,103
Or one of their descendants.

987
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,239
Dastardly's going to
use Scooby

988
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,440
to unlock the
Gates to the Underworld.

989
00:53:05,507 --> 00:53:07,342
So what? What happens then?

990
00:53:07,408 --> 00:53:10,311
Then all hell breaks loose.
Literally.

991
00:53:10,378 --> 00:53:12,581
There's more than treasure
behind those gates.

992
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,549
Oh, jinkies.

993
00:53:14,616 --> 00:53:17,251
What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.

994
00:53:17,317 --> 00:53:18,185
Look over there.

995
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:24,156
Whoa.

996
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,426
"Muttley."

997
00:53:27,494 --> 00:53:28,427
Put that down!

998
00:53:31,062 --> 00:53:34,634
You have no right
to be in here, Mystery Morons.

999
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,034
It's Mystery Inc.

1000
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:37,801
Yeah, Fred. He knows.

1001
00:53:37,868 --> 00:53:39,069
Who is Muttley?

1002
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:43,475
Muttley was my partner...

1003
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:45,775
my criminal co-conspirator.

1004
00:53:45,842 --> 00:53:49,345
Until... Until...

1005
00:53:49,412 --> 00:53:52,814
<i>I opened a portal,
a backdoor to the underworld.</i>

1006
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:56,519
<i>And through it,
a glowing gold vision.</i>

1007
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,124
<i>As I was about to enter,</i>

1008
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:06,861
<i>Muttley insisted on taking
the risk himself.</i>

1009
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,463
Rasm-Frasm.

1010
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,097
Ingrate.

1011
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:15,101
<i>I pleaded with him,</i>

1012
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,537
<i>"Muttley,
please don't do this."</i>

1013
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:21,708
<i>But no. The flatulent fleabag
wouldn't listen to reason.</i>

1014
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:25,810
Ta-da!

1015
00:54:25,877 --> 00:54:27,713
Good boy, Muttley. Bring it!

1016
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,782
Yes, yes, come on.

1017
00:54:29,847 --> 00:54:32,651
<i>But that ticket
was a one-way trip.</i>

1018
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:34,084
Muttley?

1019
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:36,286
<i>Even if I'd opened
a billion portals,</i>

1020
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:37,888
<i>he could never come back.</i>

1021
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:39,856
- Uh-oh.
- Muttley!

1022
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,758
Oh, no. No!

1023
00:54:41,824 --> 00:54:43,527
Get out of there!

1024
00:54:43,593 --> 00:54:46,996
Muttley! Muttley!

1025
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:51,099
Because Muttley isn't the key.

1026
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,569
Return them to their cell.

1027
00:54:53,636 --> 00:54:55,070
Please, Dastardly,

1028
00:54:55,136 --> 00:54:56,639
if you unlock those gates,
you'll...

1029
00:54:56,705 --> 00:54:58,305
Stop!

1030
00:54:58,372 --> 00:55:00,742
Poor man's Hemsworth
stays with me.

1031
00:55:00,809 --> 00:55:01,810
- No.
- How dare you?

1032
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:03,511
Wait. Chris or Liam?

1033
00:55:03,578 --> 00:55:05,311
What are you doing with him?

1034
00:55:05,378 --> 00:55:09,315
Oh, I have grand plans
for Freddie boy.

1035
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,490
I'm picking up
the skull signature.

1036
00:55:17,557 --> 00:55:19,157
Locking on.

1037
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:20,593
These suits
are incredible, right?

1038
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,026
Yeah!

1039
00:55:22,093 --> 00:55:23,695
Accentuates the good stuff,
hides the flaws.

1040
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:25,096
I love it.

1041
00:55:25,162 --> 00:55:26,832
I wanna see
cheeks to seats, people.

1042
00:55:26,897 --> 00:55:28,099
Straps activated.

1043
00:55:28,165 --> 00:55:29,834
But my cheeks
still need a seat!

1044
00:55:29,899 --> 00:55:31,669
Here we go!

1045
00:55:45,848 --> 00:55:48,082
Shaggy, what are you doing?

1046
00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:56,890
Not so close.

1047
00:55:56,957 --> 00:55:58,091
We're about to get closer.

1048
00:55:58,158 --> 00:55:59,627
- Dee Dee, I advise we...
- Punch it!

1049
00:56:10,068 --> 00:56:12,471
Wow. The heat
from the geothermal vents

1050
00:56:12,538 --> 00:56:16,040
is creating
a completely unique ecosystem.

1051
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:18,075
Which appears to be Mesozoic.

1052
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,115
Just land the ship, Dee Dee!

1053
00:56:40,662 --> 00:56:43,498
Okay, Falcon Force.
Good luck.

1054
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:44,999
Bring back that skull.

1055
00:56:45,065 --> 00:56:46,535
Scooby and I will stay
on the ship.

1056
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:48,437
You know,
where it's safe and secure.

1057
00:56:48,503 --> 00:56:51,371
Dude, I'm pretty sure Scooby
is gonna be safest with us.

1058
00:56:51,439 --> 00:56:53,072
We're literally superheroes.

1059
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,108
No, you don't get it.

1060
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:57,644
We're chickens
and we always stick together,

1061
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,111
so we're staying here.

1062
00:56:59,612 --> 00:57:00,547
Scoob?

1063
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:01,815
Scoob's clearly important

1064
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:04,551
to whatever Dastardly's
got planned. We need him.

1065
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:07,118
Yeah. I'm the key.

1066
00:57:07,185 --> 00:57:09,987
The key? You're not the key.

1067
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:11,890
You're my best friend.

1068
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:13,223
At least I thought you were

1069
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,292
until you whipped off
your collar.

1070
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:18,962
My collar? You gave me the nod.

1071
00:57:19,029 --> 00:57:21,565
But I didn't think
you'd really do it.

1072
00:57:21,631 --> 00:57:22,998
Just come with us.

1073
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,967
"Us"? You're an "us" now?

1074
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:26,870
Well, what happened to us-us?

1075
00:57:26,937 --> 00:57:28,237
Raggy.

1076
00:57:28,304 --> 00:57:30,038
You need to choose.

1077
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,240
Now, I'm staying on the ship.

1078
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:34,743
Are you staying with me,
or going with them?

1079
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:36,344
That's not fair.

1080
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,045
Choose.

1081
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:49,288
I never thought I'd say this,
but Simon Cowell was right.

1082
00:57:49,355 --> 00:57:51,758
You can't count on friendship.

1083
00:57:59,532 --> 00:58:01,833
You know what?
Simon Cowell is always right.

1084
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,200
He gave the world
Kelly Clarkson.

1085
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:05,871
I mean, how much proof
do you need?

1086
00:58:05,937 --> 00:58:07,506
Hey, man,
that breakup was brutal.

1087
00:58:07,572 --> 00:58:09,405
All right, Shaggy was totally
out of line.

1088
00:58:09,473 --> 00:58:12,710
We've never had
a fight before.

1089
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:14,110
Brian!

1090
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:16,579
Less talk, more walk!

1091
00:58:16,646 --> 00:58:19,314
See? I'm dealing with
the same thing with Dynobutt.

1092
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:20,884
He's constantly riding me.

1093
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,953
He expects me to be
just like my dad, and I'm not.

1094
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:25,454
No, you're not.

1095
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:27,756
All I need is a moment.
A hero moment.

1096
00:58:27,823 --> 00:58:30,626
To prove to him and the world
that I can do this.

1097
00:58:30,692 --> 00:58:32,793
Maybe we both do.

1098
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:38,298
This thing still isn't working.

1099
00:58:38,365 --> 00:58:40,001
Dyno, what do you got?

1100
00:58:42,134 --> 00:58:43,637
I got bupkis.

1101
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:45,505
Who needs your techno-malarkey
when we got this guy?

1102
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:48,941
Now, let's let the real dog
sniff out this bone.

1103
00:58:52,945 --> 00:58:53,812
Got it!

1104
00:58:57,015 --> 00:58:58,416
Have fun being last!

1105
00:59:20,168 --> 00:59:21,268
What are you doing?

1106
00:59:21,335 --> 00:59:23,772
Huh. Raggy's never missed.

1107
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:25,974
Hello!

1108
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:30,044
Your tiny little brains
probably can't understand me.

1109
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:34,448
So, I will speak slowly,

1110
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:35,950
so that you may process

1111
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:39,184
the welcoming tones
of my voice.

1112
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:41,654
Uh, we understand
you perfectly.

1113
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:43,423
Oh, word? No disrespect.

1114
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:45,256
So, what brings you guys
to Mystery Island?

1115
00:59:45,323 --> 00:59:46,992
We're looking for a skull.

1116
00:59:47,059 --> 00:59:48,225
Yeah, it's about yea high,

1117
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:49,360
and full of sharp,
pointy teeth.

1118
00:59:49,428 --> 00:59:51,162
You mean a slaghoople?

1119
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:52,597
Um, sure.

1120
00:59:52,663 --> 00:59:54,632
Why didn't you say so?
Follow me.

1121
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:56,701
And mind
the pterodactyl droppings.

1122
01:00:00,937 --> 01:00:02,137
But if you
get some on you, rub it in.

1123
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:03,640
It's just like lotion.

1124
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:08,510
Huh?

1125
01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:29,796
I will never leave you.
No matter what.

1126
01:00:33,566 --> 01:00:35,401
Huh?

1127
01:00:39,905 --> 01:00:40,905
Hey!

1128
01:00:40,972 --> 01:00:41,973
Fred?

1129
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,942
- Shaggy?
- Fred!

1130
01:00:44,009 --> 01:00:45,577
Shaggy!

1131
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:48,479
Wait, how'd you get here?
Where are Daphne and Velma?

1132
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:50,047
Dastardly kidnapped us

1133
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:54,084
and was holding us captive
on his super awesome airship.

1134
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,819
Jeez, that thing is cool.

1135
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,186
But never mind that.

1136
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:00,288
Where's Scooby-Doo?
Has he been taken?

1137
01:01:00,355 --> 01:01:04,093
No. He's with
his new "hero" friends.

1138
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,228
We're on a break.
You've missed a lot.

1139
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:08,295
Shaggy,

1140
01:01:08,362 --> 01:01:10,132
Scooby-Doo is in grave danger.

1141
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:11,466
Dastardly's on his way here
right now,

1142
01:01:11,533 --> 01:01:13,701
and he won't stop
until he gets him.

1143
01:01:13,768 --> 01:01:16,771
Dastardly?
We can't let that happen.

1144
01:01:16,837 --> 01:01:19,907
Exactly!
Now, take me to Scooby-Doo.

1145
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:22,575
As it turns out,

1146
01:01:22,642 --> 01:01:25,645
I wasn't even
the velociraptor's father.

1147
01:01:25,712 --> 01:01:30,314
Anyhoo, there it is.
The slaghoople.

1148
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:32,751
Brian, we found the last skull.

1149
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:34,019
Mission accomplished.

1150
01:01:34,086 --> 01:01:36,254
Now, if you would give us
a hand carrying it out,

1151
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,187
we'll take it back to our jet.

1152
01:01:37,254 --> 01:01:38,456
Uh-uh-uh.

1153
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:40,257
The only way
to take the slaghoople

1154
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,960
is to defeat the protector
in battle.

1155
01:01:43,027 --> 01:01:44,561
And that's me.

1156
01:01:44,628 --> 01:01:45,729
You?

1157
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:47,764
Scooby, this is it.
It's my hero moment.

1158
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:50,067
I can totally pound the crap
out of this little guy.

1159
01:01:50,133 --> 01:01:52,069
Doesn't sound heroic.

1160
01:01:52,135 --> 01:01:53,502
Hey, you're on,

1161
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:55,071
but I think you're gonna need
a few friends.

1162
01:01:55,137 --> 01:01:59,207
Oh, I've got friends.
And they do like a good show.

1163
01:02:14,755 --> 01:02:18,858
All right now.
Let's get our fight on!

1164
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,462
Come at me, little man.

1165
01:02:22,528 --> 01:02:24,328
Little?

1166
01:02:24,396 --> 01:02:25,964
Did you just call me little?

1167
01:02:26,031 --> 01:02:27,199
No. He said big.

1168
01:02:27,264 --> 01:02:29,300
I did call you little,
pipsqueak.

1169
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:30,736
He said big squeak.

1170
01:02:30,802 --> 01:02:32,670
You can call me...

1171
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:40,242
Captain Caveman!

1172
01:02:43,913 --> 01:02:47,684
I know I'm small.
It's a pituitary thing.

1173
01:02:51,687 --> 01:02:53,956
Are you not entertained?

1174
01:02:54,022 --> 01:02:56,256
Brian! Come on.

1175
01:02:56,323 --> 01:02:58,860
Dynomutt is right.

1176
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:01,129
I'm not my dad.

1177
01:03:02,997 --> 01:03:04,431
Scooby, help!

1178
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:05,465
What do I do?

1179
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,033
Use the suit thingies.

1180
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,334
Who's your captain?

1181
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:09,770
Captain Caveman!

1182
01:03:09,836 --> 01:03:12,005
Hoorah!

1183
01:03:12,072 --> 01:03:13,038
Huh?

1184
01:03:21,913 --> 01:03:23,681
Huh. Hey.

1185
01:03:29,052 --> 01:03:31,522
Wow, you're doing great.

1186
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:35,192
I almost hate
to do this to you.

1187
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:37,727
Spin it to win it.

1188
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:40,730
I want my Raggy!

1189
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:46,501
Oh!

1190
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:47,736
You make a break for the skull.

1191
01:03:47,803 --> 01:03:49,037
I'll go pick up
Brian and Scooby.

1192
01:03:49,104 --> 01:03:50,304
On it.

1193
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:52,740
Leave him alone.

1194
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:55,709
I love a challenge
like I love dinosaur eggs.

1195
01:03:55,776 --> 01:03:57,044
Over easy.

1196
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,682
- Uh...
- Look out!

1197
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,353
Dang, those are
some dope wheels.

1198
01:04:11,924 --> 01:04:14,259
Whatever wheels are!

1199
01:04:14,325 --> 01:04:16,961
- Scooby!
- Raggy?

1200
01:04:17,028 --> 01:04:18,830
- How'd you get here?
- No, let me go first.

1201
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,064
- Scoob...
- Where did that

1202
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:21,399
anachronistic van come from?

1203
01:04:21,465 --> 01:04:22,834
Fred brought it,
but that's not important.

1204
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,367
How'd he get the van
to a prehistoric world

1205
01:04:24,434 --> 01:04:25,902
hidden miles beneath
the North Pole?

1206
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:27,336
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Fred...

1207
01:04:27,404 --> 01:04:28,939
Who's Fred?

1208
01:04:29,005 --> 01:04:30,540
- ...right now, I need to...
- Not me.

1209
01:04:35,477 --> 01:04:36,946
Dick Dastardly!

1210
01:04:37,012 --> 01:04:38,247
That's right.

1211
01:04:38,314 --> 01:04:39,582
Your foolish friend

1212
01:04:39,648 --> 01:04:42,050
- led me straight to you.
- Oh, no.

1213
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:51,391
If you will excuse me,
I have a treasure to collect.

1214
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:55,329
Raggy!

1215
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:56,762
Scooby!

1216
01:04:56,829 --> 01:05:00,199
Oh, and I almost forgot
to take out the rubbish.

1217
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:01,767
Whoa!

1218
01:05:08,373 --> 01:05:10,842
- Whoa, nice catch!
- Ahhh!

1219
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:12,443
- What's up?
- Ta-ta!

1220
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,211
See you all in Athens.

1221
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:15,679
Oh! No, you won't.

1222
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,815
Because the only way out
is with a jet.

1223
01:05:17,882 --> 01:05:19,450
Well, good thing we have one.

1224
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:22,685
Oh, do you now?

1225
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,690
There's something
about the way he said,

1226
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,292
"Do you?" and then laughed

1227
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,829
that makes me think
he did something to our ship.

1228
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:38,399
I hate it when I'm right.

1229
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:40,601
We're lucky
it doesn't happen often.

1230
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:43,938
Ugh.

1231
01:05:49,142 --> 01:05:51,645
The primary engine
is destroyed.

1232
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:53,045
The thrusters are intact,

1233
01:05:53,112 --> 01:05:55,347
but they're way too small
to launch the ship.

1234
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,283
So, we're stuck here?

1235
01:05:57,349 --> 01:05:58,617
Well, maybe
if your little buddy

1236
01:05:58,684 --> 01:06:00,418
didn't lead the bad guy
right to us...

1237
01:06:00,485 --> 01:06:02,353
Leave Shaggy alone.

1238
01:06:02,453 --> 01:06:05,290
Yeah, what kind of hero blames
other people for his problems?

1239
01:06:05,357 --> 01:06:06,392
Meet Brian.

1240
01:06:06,457 --> 01:06:07,625
Hey, you shut your dog face.

1241
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:09,159
You shut your face-face.

1242
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:11,362
Because of you, Scooby-Doo has
a first-class ticket

1243
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:12,729
to the dogpocalypse.

1244
01:06:12,796 --> 01:06:14,097
Don't you point
your finger at me.

1245
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:16,432
Well, don't double-point
your finger at me.

1246
01:06:16,499 --> 01:06:18,034
Maybe I'll triple-finger point
at you.

1247
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,270
Then obviously I'm gonna
quadruple-finger point at you.

1248
01:06:21,337 --> 01:06:22,972
Ha! That's just a wave,
dipstick.

1249
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,340
Hey, get off of him.

1250
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:27,309
He's the one that started it!

1251
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:29,277
Toxic masculinity.

1252
01:06:29,344 --> 01:06:31,680
Stop! Stop it, all of you!

1253
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:35,082
It's my fault. I'm to blame.

1254
01:06:35,149 --> 01:06:38,953
I let my own jealousy
break me and Scooby up.

1255
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:42,722
I was afraid that with his
new suit and his new team,

1256
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:44,624
things were gonna change.

1257
01:06:46,759 --> 01:06:48,760
And they did change.

1258
01:06:48,827 --> 01:06:52,931
But, like, that's okay.
People can grow.

1259
01:06:52,998 --> 01:06:55,901
But it doesn't mean
that we're growing apart.

1260
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:58,803
Because the one thing
that will never change

1261
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:02,707
is that Scooby-Doo
is my best friend.

1262
01:07:03,408 --> 01:07:04,808
Ten years ago,

1263
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:07,544
a little boy made a promise
to a stray puppy

1264
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,580
that he'd never leave him,
no matter what.

1265
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:12,748
And I'm gonna keep
that promise.

1266
01:07:12,815 --> 01:07:15,818
Now, it's time we stop
this mustachioed menace

1267
01:07:15,884 --> 01:07:18,020
from opening the gates
to the underpass...

1268
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:19,655
- Underworld.
- And letting loose

1269
01:07:19,722 --> 01:07:21,322
the fearsome sippy-cup.

1270
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,991
- Cerberus.
- So, what do you say

1271
01:07:23,057 --> 01:07:25,760
- we get out of Middle-earth...
- Copyright infringement.

1272
01:07:25,827 --> 01:07:28,228
...and go get
my always-snacking,

1273
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:32,065
never-lacking,
often-napping dog back!

1274
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,133
Who's with me?

1275
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,435
We are!

1276
01:07:35,769 --> 01:07:37,203
Let's do this.

1277
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,009
Hey!

1278
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:48,279
That one! Thank you!

1279
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:53,817
Momma!

1280
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:10,265
Dad! What is that thing?

1281
01:08:22,276 --> 01:08:23,811
Oh, I've waited!

1282
01:08:23,878 --> 01:08:27,047
I've waited and waited
for this very moment!

1283
01:09:10,453 --> 01:09:11,619
Give me your paw.

1284
01:09:11,686 --> 01:09:14,188
- No!
- What?

1285
01:09:14,254 --> 01:09:16,990
Back again like a bad oyster.

1286
01:09:17,057 --> 01:09:20,626
Guys, supernatural
transformation dead ahead.

1287
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:26,165
I thought
you mewling millennials

1288
01:09:26,232 --> 01:09:27,033
were done for good!

1289
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,068
Destroy those falcon fools!

1290
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,618
- Yes!
- No!

1291
01:10:09,936 --> 01:10:12,373
Whoa!

1292
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,482
No!

1293
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:25,817
I told you, you were the most
important dog in the world.

1294
01:10:25,884 --> 01:10:28,319
Now let me show you why.

1295
01:10:32,656 --> 01:10:35,292
And the slipper fits.

1296
01:10:39,263 --> 01:10:40,497
It's happening!

1297
01:10:40,564 --> 01:10:42,899
It's finally happening!

1298
01:10:52,774 --> 01:10:53,875
Uh-oh.

1299
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:55,677
Little more than
I bargained for.

1300
01:10:56,977 --> 01:10:59,581
If I were you, I'd run!

1301
01:11:06,186 --> 01:11:07,488
Monster!

1302
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,922
Hurry! Daddy!

1303
01:11:15,861 --> 01:11:17,696
You guys are alive!

1304
01:11:17,763 --> 01:11:19,764
Scooby-Doo!

1305
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,199
Scooby!

1306
01:11:21,265 --> 01:11:22,568
Yoo-hoo!

1307
01:11:22,634 --> 01:11:25,337
Oh, thank goodness! The gang's
finally back together.

1308
01:11:25,404 --> 01:11:29,272
- Buddy, I never meant to...
- I know. Me neither.

1309
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,740
All right.

1310
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:33,243
<i>Time to take that 3-headed
hound down to the pound.</i>

1311
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,245
<i>Is everyone accounted for?</i>

1312
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,187
Whew. Well, that was
my cardio for the day.

1313
01:11:46,254 --> 01:11:47,956
Dynomutt, you saved us.

1314
01:11:48,022 --> 01:11:48,990
Yeah, thank you!

1315
01:11:49,057 --> 01:11:50,392
Yes, Dynomutt!

1316
01:12:08,139 --> 01:12:11,843
At long last, my treasure!

1317
01:12:23,153 --> 01:12:24,153
Oh, no.

1318
01:12:25,623 --> 01:12:27,023
I'm too late.

1319
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:32,160
I've been searching for years,
my friend.

1320
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:34,330
But I didn't make it in time.

1321
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:38,800
I'm sorry.

1322
01:12:39,569 --> 01:12:43,472
I'm so, so sorry.

1323
01:12:43,538 --> 01:12:45,072
There are so many things

1324
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:47,108
we never got to do together.

1325
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:53,046
Huh?

1326
01:12:53,113 --> 01:12:55,516
You're alive?

1327
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,016
You're alive!

1328
01:12:57,082 --> 01:13:00,252
You cantankerous canine,
how could you do that to me?

1329
01:13:01,053 --> 01:13:03,222
Rasm-Frasm.

1330
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:06,492
Stop! I'm not joking! Stop!

1331
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:09,994
Oh! I...

1332
01:13:10,061 --> 01:13:11,696
I can't stay mad.

1333
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:13,564
You're alive!

1334
01:13:23,005 --> 01:13:25,642
So, that's Cerberus.

1335
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:28,444
We've got to stop him
before he gets into the city.

1336
01:13:28,511 --> 01:13:29,811
Like, how?

1337
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:31,347
We fight monsters
all the time.

1338
01:13:31,414 --> 01:13:32,914
Remember the phantom sea squid
at the haunted aquarium?

1339
01:13:32,981 --> 01:13:34,550
That was
a real estate developer

1340
01:13:34,617 --> 01:13:37,117
with a couple of flashlights
and a sound effects machine.

1341
01:13:37,184 --> 01:13:39,454
This is the real deal.
Right, Fred?

1342
01:13:39,953 --> 01:13:41,021
Fred?

1343
01:13:41,623 --> 01:13:42,490
Where's Fred?

1344
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,396
You shall be avenged.

1345
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:02,973
For the Mystery Machine!

1346
01:14:06,411 --> 01:14:07,911
He's just attacking.

1347
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:09,447
I mean, are we supposed
to be attacking?

1348
01:14:10,715 --> 01:14:12,882
Huh?

1349
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,254
- Fred!
- Come on. Hurry! Run!

1350
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:25,294
Sorry, gang. Never mess
with another man's vehicle.

1351
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:28,297
We need a plan.

1352
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:31,065
Okay, like, Velma and Fred,
you get to the gate

1353
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:33,033
and, uh, figure out
how to close it.

1354
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,836
And we'll distract Cerberus.

1355
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:36,304
Great idea, guys.

1356
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,438
That was awesome!

1357
01:14:37,505 --> 01:14:38,840
Smart.

1358
01:14:38,905 --> 01:14:41,475
Yeah,
we've been through a lot.

1359
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:42,908
We've grown.

1360
01:14:46,011 --> 01:14:48,146
Brian!

1361
01:14:48,213 --> 01:14:51,015
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

1362
01:14:54,387 --> 01:14:55,454
Now, Velma!

1363
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,454
Let's go!

1364
01:14:57,822 --> 01:14:58,956
What do we do?

1365
01:14:59,022 --> 01:15:01,125
Maybe he wants a Scooby Snack?

1366
01:15:02,259 --> 01:15:04,227
I don't have any Scooby Snacks.

1367
01:15:05,228 --> 01:15:06,530
I always have a spare.

1368
01:15:08,866 --> 01:15:10,199
Sorry.

1369
01:15:10,266 --> 01:15:12,267
And that's why
I always have a spare spare.

1370
01:15:13,836 --> 01:15:15,605
Scooby!

1371
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:17,172
I'm so weak.

1372
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:20,975
<i>Nice doggy.</i>

1373
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:24,679
I got this.

1374
01:15:41,594 --> 01:15:42,595
Look out!

1375
01:15:46,565 --> 01:15:49,233
Are you okay, little guy?

1376
01:15:53,337 --> 01:15:56,607
Brian, what are you
doing back here?

1377
01:15:56,674 --> 01:15:57,941
I'm calling my dad.

1378
01:15:58,342 --> 01:15:59,176
Hey!

1379
01:15:59,242 --> 01:16:00,943
You don't need your dad.

1380
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:03,179
Yes, I do, all right?
He's the hero.

1381
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:04,581
I'm not. I can't win this.

1382
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:07,183
So what?
Look at Scooby and Shaggy!

1383
01:16:07,249 --> 01:16:10,018
They're terrified, and they're
taking on Cerberus!

1384
01:16:10,084 --> 01:16:11,520
I'm terrified!

1385
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:15,056
Why are we
taking on Cerberus?

1386
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:21,729
Well, in their own unique way.

1387
01:16:21,796 --> 01:16:24,096
So you're saying it's heroic
to be scared,

1388
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:25,998
and even to lose sometimes?

1389
01:16:27,568 --> 01:16:29,168
Dude, this is it!

1390
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:32,805
This is my hero moment,
my real hero moment.

1391
01:16:32,872 --> 01:16:34,272
And it's my moment, too.

1392
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,274
My job is to have your back.

1393
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:39,411
So what do you say,
Blue Falcon?

1394
01:16:41,546 --> 01:16:44,048
Okay, now I'm crying.

1395
01:16:44,114 --> 01:16:45,550
- Dyno!
- Help!

1396
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:48,117
Scooby and Shaggy
are about to be puppy chow.

1397
01:16:48,184 --> 01:16:51,856
It's time for you
to spread your wings and fly.

1398
01:16:51,922 --> 01:16:53,324
You're right.

1399
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:54,692
This suit just makes me a hero
on the outside.

1400
01:16:54,758 --> 01:16:57,760
It's time to tap
into the hero. In here.

1401
01:16:57,827 --> 01:17:00,730
You know your suit has actual
wings and can fly, right?

1402
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,767
Oh, right. The wings!

1403
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:08,403
Let's do this!

1404
01:17:12,273 --> 01:17:15,242
I got a little too excited
on the takeoff.

1405
01:17:15,309 --> 01:17:17,311
This way, Scooby-Doo!

1406
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:26,386
Oh, Cerberus.

1407
01:17:26,453 --> 01:17:28,554
Here, poochie-boy.

1408
01:17:39,964 --> 01:17:41,633
This superhero stuff is fun!

1409
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,066
Whoa!

1410
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:46,135
Scooby!

1411
01:17:46,202 --> 01:17:48,739
- I got you.
- Ooh.

1412
01:17:48,805 --> 01:17:49,973
Farewell, fools!

1413
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:51,741
<i>Sayonara,</i> suckers!

1414
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:52,708
Dastardly!

1415
01:17:52,775 --> 01:17:54,010
We're rich!

1416
01:17:54,075 --> 01:17:56,345
Rasm-Frasm. Money bath!

1417
01:17:56,412 --> 01:17:58,213
Aw. He got his friend back.

1418
01:17:58,281 --> 01:17:59,948
Daphne, focus.

1419
01:18:00,015 --> 01:18:02,751
I wish I had that
clue from Dastardly's ship.

1420
01:18:02,817 --> 01:18:04,786
You mean this thing?

1421
01:18:04,853 --> 01:18:06,655
Are you telling me
you had that the whole time?

1422
01:18:06,721 --> 01:18:08,889
Better late than never!

1423
01:18:08,956 --> 01:18:10,424
This is awesome!

1424
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:12,693
Oh, good.
They got him distracted.

1425
01:18:13,226 --> 01:18:14,762
Hey, little guy.

1426
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:15,995
Remember at the bowling alley

1427
01:18:16,061 --> 01:18:17,697
when you transformed
into that thing?

1428
01:18:19,365 --> 01:18:21,166
No. No, no, no.
Not that scary thing.

1429
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:23,535
Huh.
Looks like a riddle.

1430
01:18:23,602 --> 01:18:25,069
Or a prophecy?

1431
01:18:25,136 --> 01:18:27,306
"Two brothers
bridge the earthly void.

1432
01:18:27,372 --> 01:18:30,375
One man, one dog.
The key employed."

1433
01:18:30,442 --> 01:18:32,610
"One to open, two to close,

1434
01:18:32,677 --> 01:18:37,348
a pair whose friendship
forever grows."

1435
01:18:37,415 --> 01:18:41,150
That's it! It takes
one to open but two to lock.

1436
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,788
Okay.
Before the creepy scorpion

1437
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:46,323
but after the scary pin.

1438
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:49,123
Yeah. Yeah, that's it!

1439
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:50,693
But there's a catch.

1440
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:06,105
Incoming! We've gotta get
Cerberus closer to the gate!

1441
01:19:06,172 --> 01:19:07,239
On it!

1442
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:13,211
Here, doggy, doggy, doggy.

1443
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:36,733
Man, looks like
we just spared the world!

1444
01:19:36,799 --> 01:19:39,669
Bowling puns.

1445
01:19:39,736 --> 01:19:41,304
This is so us.

1446
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:49,544
Okay, so how do we lock
that puppy up?

1447
01:19:52,813 --> 01:19:53,981
What?

1448
01:19:54,048 --> 01:19:56,117
One of you has to hold
the gates shut here...

1449
01:19:56,182 --> 01:20:00,453
While one of you locks them
from inside the Underworld.

1450
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,688
What? No!

1451
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:04,591
There has to be another way.
Right, Velma?

1452
01:20:04,658 --> 01:20:06,393
Alexander the Great
built these gates

1453
01:20:06,459 --> 01:20:11,063
to be locked only by him
and his dog Peritas.

1454
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:14,232
As the last descendant
of Peritas,

1455
01:20:14,299 --> 01:20:15,900
Scooby has to do it.

1456
01:20:15,967 --> 01:20:19,404
But the prophecy says he needs
his best friend to help him.

1457
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:20,838
That's you, Shaggy.

1458
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:34,350
There's no other way.
I'm the key.

1459
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:35,918
I'll go.

1460
01:20:46,695 --> 01:20:49,263
It says one of us
had to be on the inside,

1461
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:51,230
but it doesn't say which one.

1462
01:20:51,298 --> 01:20:53,434
No!

1463
01:20:59,372 --> 01:21:04,042
Buddy, back when we were kids,
you saved me.

1464
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,243
Now it's my turn.

1465
01:21:06,311 --> 01:21:08,780
No. Don't. Raggy, wait!

1466
01:21:08,847 --> 01:21:10,682
No!

1467
01:21:18,055 --> 01:21:19,556
Raggy.

1468
01:21:19,622 --> 01:21:22,959
Scoob. You're the best friend
I could ever ask for.

1469
01:21:24,794 --> 01:21:27,796
And you always will be.

1470
01:22:20,276 --> 01:22:23,545
Raggy.

1471
01:22:23,612 --> 01:22:25,547
Are we missing something?

1472
01:22:25,614 --> 01:22:28,150
"A pair whose friendship
forever grows."

1473
01:22:29,284 --> 01:22:31,585
Could it mean something else?

1474
01:22:31,652 --> 01:22:33,988
I think it means that
Scoob and Shaggy's friendship

1475
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:37,625
will live on whether
they're together or not.

1476
01:22:39,826 --> 01:22:41,861
But...

1477
01:22:41,928 --> 01:22:43,663
...why would
Alexander make a gate

1478
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:46,466
that would separate him
from his best friend forever?

1479
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:48,901
He must have built a way out.

1480
01:22:49,868 --> 01:22:51,570
Uh... Guys.

1481
01:22:55,139 --> 01:22:56,808
It's Alexander the Great.

1482
01:22:59,744 --> 01:23:02,580
Look at this inscription.
It's a message from him.

1483
01:23:02,647 --> 01:23:05,415
"Our bond
will never break or bend..."

1484
01:23:05,482 --> 01:23:10,887
"So, my friend, it's time
to return to your home."

1485
01:23:10,954 --> 01:23:12,988
Maybe Scooby
should give it a try.

1486
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:26,467
Raggy, you promised
you'd never leave.

1487
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:28,068
Come home.

1488
01:23:38,278 --> 01:23:39,412
Raggy?

1489
01:23:43,849 --> 01:23:44,916
Zoinks!

1490
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:48,420
I guess friendship
really did save the day.

1491
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:49,521
Raggy!

1492
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:52,122
Scooby-Doo!

1493
01:23:54,124 --> 01:23:56,093
I love you guys!

1494
01:23:58,562 --> 01:24:00,897
You gave us
quite a scare, Shaggy.

1495
01:24:05,034 --> 01:24:07,803
Well, it takes more
than a 3-headed monster

1496
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:10,839
to keep me away
from my best bud.

1497
01:24:11,707 --> 01:24:14,009
Tank, empath, brain.

1498
01:24:15,376 --> 01:24:17,246
I finally figured out
what you guys are.

1499
01:24:17,312 --> 01:24:19,814
You're the heart
of Mystery, Inc.

1500
01:24:26,953 --> 01:24:28,655
Ow, ow, oh. Ow!

1501
01:24:28,722 --> 01:24:31,724
Sorry. Metal tongue.
Shoulda thought that through.

1502
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:34,627
Put me down,
you traitorous tin cans!

1503
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:41,032
Rasm-Frasm. Stupid robots.

1504
01:24:41,099 --> 01:24:44,102
Time to pay for your crimes,
Dick Dastardly.

1505
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:45,637
Or is it?

1506
01:24:48,438 --> 01:24:50,308
Simon Cowell?

1507
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:54,245
Wow, that is
a solid impersonation.

1508
01:24:54,312 --> 01:24:55,279
Thank you.

1509
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:57,079
I also played Rum Tum Tugger

1510
01:24:57,146 --> 01:25:00,350
in my secondary school's
production of <i>Cats.</i>

1511
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:01,584
This makes no sense.

1512
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:02,852
How could he have time to judge

1513
01:25:02,918 --> 01:25:04,220
the world's
greatest talent shows

1514
01:25:04,287 --> 01:25:05,587
and build a giant airship?

1515
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:09,691
Dick Dastardly?

1516
01:25:09,758 --> 01:25:12,893
Drat. No one ever goes
for the double unmasking.

1517
01:25:14,762 --> 01:25:16,497
You are coming with us.

1518
01:25:16,563 --> 01:25:18,198
I would've gotten away with it

1519
01:25:18,266 --> 01:25:19,300
if it weren't for you

1520
01:25:19,366 --> 01:25:23,036
mismatched meddling miscreants!

1521
01:25:23,102 --> 01:25:26,039
Congratulations, you two.

1522
01:25:26,105 --> 01:25:27,172
You just saved the world.

1523
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,140
How do you feel?

1524
01:25:29,242 --> 01:25:30,343
Hungry.

1525
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:42,620
Oh, man. It's perfect.

1526
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:44,688
Wait, Shaggy,
where's the DJ you hired?

1527
01:25:44,754 --> 01:25:46,823
Like, they'll be here
any minute.

1528
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,657
"They"?

1529
01:26:04,605 --> 01:26:05,873
Surprise!

1530
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,874
You know we wouldn't
miss your grand opening.

1531
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:10,644
<i>DJ Blue Falcon!</i>

1532
01:26:13,547 --> 01:26:16,549
And that is how
you make an entrance.

1533
01:26:17,116 --> 01:26:18,318
Good job, Keith.

1534
01:26:18,385 --> 01:26:19,652
<i>Thank you, BF!</i>

1535
01:26:30,762 --> 01:26:33,197
I'm so happy you're back.

1536
01:26:37,469 --> 01:26:38,835
You know, I'm proud of him,

1537
01:26:38,901 --> 01:26:40,837
but he couldn't have done this
without us.

1538
01:26:40,903 --> 01:26:44,607
I know.
I am so gonna need a raise.

1539
01:26:52,315 --> 01:26:53,216
Hello?

1540
01:26:53,282 --> 01:26:54,849
<i>Hello, Mystery Inc.?</i>

1541
01:26:54,915 --> 01:26:56,951
<i>There's been a mysterious
sighting in San Pedro.</i>

1542
01:26:57,018 --> 01:26:59,520
<i>Residents report seeing
a phantom tuna trawler</i>

1543
01:26:59,587 --> 01:27:01,188
<i>and the ghost
of an old sea captain.</i>

1544
01:27:01,256 --> 01:27:02,424
G-g-g-ghost?

1545
01:27:02,491 --> 01:27:03,957
Looks like we're on the case.

1546
01:27:04,024 --> 01:27:05,058
Let's hit it.

1547
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:07,660
Hey, Dusty!
Watch the shop, please.

1548
01:27:08,962 --> 01:27:10,929
What do you say, buddy?

1549
01:27:10,996 --> 01:27:14,166
Let's Scooby-Dooby-Doo it!
