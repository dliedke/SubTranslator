00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:56,936
<i>This is live coverage of the 1959
24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

3
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,749
<i>We've reached the half-way point and so far witnessed
Aston Martin Number 5 driven by Carroll Shelby</i>

4
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:05,119
<i>making great games in the last hour.</i>

5
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:07,978
<i>If he keeps this pace up
he could have a chance at the...</i>

6
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,797
He's coming in. He's coming in.

7
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,959
Let's go!

8
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,339
I know you're tired.
Come on! Let's make it fast!

9
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,273
Go! Go! Go!

10
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,997
She's running a little hot.

11
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,156
Fire!

12
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,729
Give him blanket.

13
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:47,281
Get it off me! Off!

14
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:50,400
You okay?

15
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,539
Fill the tank!

16
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,024
- Shelby, you just...
- Am I on fire?

17
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,649
- Am I on goddamn fire?
- No, you're not...

18
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,892
Fill the tank!

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,232
- Where am I, Eddie?
- 2 laps up by Frank.

20
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:10,423
We're good. Go get them.

21
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:37,169
<i>Aston Martin Number 5 driven by
Carroll Shelby is maintaining his lead</i>

22
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:39,453
<i>as we are hearing
the final minutes of the race.</i>

23
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,134
Shelby.

24
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,134
<i>The crown is at their feet.</i>

25
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,231
- Shelby.
- <i>Takes the title.</i>

26
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,026
<i>An American wins Le Mans!</i>

27
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:50,489
Shelby!

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,376
- Carroll Shelby.
- What?

29
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,767
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

30
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,342
I take the pills. The pills work.

31
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:01,950
An elevated heart rate, say 130 BPM

32
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,096
sustained even for a short period,
you run a critical risk of cardiac arrest.

33
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,666
- I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

34
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,435
I can race NASCAR, Formula 1.

35
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,313
The valve is shot, Shelby.
This is as serious as it gets.

36
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:18,292
In my opinion you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

37
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,546
I feel real lucky.

38
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,804
Luckiest guy on Earth.

39
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:49,248
There's a point at 7000 RPM
where everything fades.

40
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:02,437
The machine becomes weightless.
Just disappears.

41
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:15,673
And all that's left is a body
moving through space and time.

42
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:23,873
7000 RPM.

43
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:26,979
That's where you meet it.

44
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:32,510
It asks you a question.

45
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,406
The only question that matters.

46
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,715
"Who are you"?

47
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,319
Now it's Von Trips in the Ferrari
coming into the corkscrew.

48
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,566
He is breaking late,

49
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:55,273
He's set a new lap record!

50
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:57,770
No, you don't!

51
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,079
A month ago this car was fun.

52
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,748
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does it's...

53
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:10,028
When I pull out of the driveway
the dog has a heart attack.

54
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:13,011
All I'm asking is for you
to make it like it was.

55
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,984
You've cocked up the inlet valves
and the cloaks...

56
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:18,452
Nothing wrong with the car.
It's the way it's being driven.

57
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,597
The way it's being driven?

58
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:21,888
Too much fuel and not enough spark.
That's what's making her misfire.

59
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:24,091
You wanna run that
by me in English?

60
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,623
All right, sir.

61
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,498
That there... That is a sport car.

62
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:35,783
You have to drive her like a sport car.

63
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,802
If you drive her like a school teacher,
she'll clog up.

64
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,567
Try changing up at 5000 RPM, not two.

65
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:48,259
Drive like you mean it.
Hard, tight, she'll run clean.

66
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:52,349
Are you telling me
I don't know how to drive my own car?

67
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:54,498
No.

68
00:05:54,825 --> 00:06:00,518
But if you ask me, this isn't your car.
Your car is more Plymouth, Studebaker.

69
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,255
You and me have a problem, buddy?

70
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:07,661
I don't have a problem.
I run MG. Mine's just fine.

71
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:10,976
Screw you you limey prick!
I want my money back!

72
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,282
Behave. I'd give it to ya.

73
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:15,459
But you haven't paid
for last months service yet.

74
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,214
This country,
the customer is always right.

75
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:20,357
- You ever hear of that?
- Yeah.

76
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,057
Utter nonsense.

77
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:28,039
And remember, I advanced the timing,
so, smidge twitchy in first!

78
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:32,322
Give her revs up. Good lad. Return.

79
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,957
Ciao.

80
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:39,544
Another satisfied customer?

81
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,688
Can I help you, Miss?

82
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,978
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

83
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,847
You know your cars.

84
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,651
I like them.

85
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:57,876
I love the sound they make.
The way it goes right through you.

86
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,774
That vibration.

87
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:08,758
Mine's the
wood paneled Country Squire.

88
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,101
Across the street.

89
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,077
The real huprod.

90
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,377
Oh, yeah?

91
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,140
- Is it fast?
- Very.

92
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,615
Wait a second.
What type of girl are you?

93
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:23,526
Type of girl who likes the smell
of wet gasoline.

94
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,048
Burnt rubber.

95
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:28,012
Are you some kind of a deviant?

96
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,616
Only since I married you.

97
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,229
Hey, Garry.
What's going on?

98
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:57,753
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

99
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,879
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

100
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,449
John!

101
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,961
Hear that?

102
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:42,770
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company

103
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:45,156
out of business.

104
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:56,010
In 1899 my grandfather
Henry my God Ford

105
00:08:56,238 --> 00:09:01,584
was walking home from Edison Illumination
after working a double shift.

106
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,907
He was ruminating.

107
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:09,285
That morning he had himself an idea
that changed the world.

108
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,679
65 years and 47 million
automobiles later,

109
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,721
what shall be his legacy?

110
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:23,580
Gettin' it in the tailpipe
from a Chevy Impala.

111
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,601
Here's what I want you to do.
Walk home.

112
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:38,527
While you're walking
I want you to ruminate.

113
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:45,162
Man comes to my office with an idea.
That man keeps his job.

114
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:50,451
Rest of you second best
losers stay home.

115
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:53,228
You don't belong in Ford.

116
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:04,118
Shelby.

117
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:09,707
I see you. Open up, buddy.

118
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,613
- Hey.
- Go away.

119
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,231
Come on. You can do it.

120
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:18,471
Come on, baby.

121
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:22,299
8:30 AM, time to row.
Let's go!

122
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,804
- Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go!
- Go away!

123
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,664
It's 8:30 AM, baby. Time to row.

124
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:29,991
Come on.

125
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,983
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Bob.

126
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,646
Is Shelby here?

127
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,655
It's touch and go.

128
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,457
Shelby. You're up bright and early.

129
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:48,213
Early bird gets the worm, Pops.

130
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:53,734
All right, who are you worried about?

131
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,925
You got Red Faris and Bill Rushton.
They're all in 327's.

132
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,639
Corvettes. What about Bondurant?

133
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,322
Bondurant, he's still driving...

134
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,764
Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?

135
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,050
Number 614.

136
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,408
All right, just relax, all right?

137
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,283
We gonna eat
those 'vettes for breakfast.

138
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:13,671
We're lighter, we're faster.
That don't work - we're nastier.

139
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,441
Hey, Bill.
Take it easy on us today, bud.

140
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,762
All right.

141
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:29,878
Paragraph 15.4 Section 2B
of the SCCA standard

142
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:36,296
dictates all AF class cars must have
minimum trunk space 20″ by 12″ by 6″.

143
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,166
Your trunk doesn't close,

144
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,372
- ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait. What?

145
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:42,909
Ergo car is disqualified from
said Class A.

146
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,134
No, no, no.

147
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:45,572
- Can I ask you a question?
- All right.

148
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,830
When you were a little boy.

149
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:52,378
Did you think, when I grow up I wanna
go to the fabled Willow Springs Raceway

150
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:58,123
and I wanna enforce Paragraph 15.4 Section 2B
of the SCCA regulations on luggage capacity.

151
00:11:58,123 --> 00:11:59,734
All right, that's it.

152
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,345
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

153
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,122
If it isn't Lance Reventlow.

154
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,250
Shelby.

155
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,075
How you're doing Lance?

156
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,048
- Pops.
- Hey Lance.

157
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:13,007
Allow me to introduce Dieter Voss. Runs
Brumos Porsche out of Jacksonville Florida.

158
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:17,218
I know all about Mr. Voss, you're having
a hell of a season with that Abarth, sir.

159
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,632
- Seeing results for your Cobra too.
- Thank you.

160
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:22,623
- Your guy Miles is impressive.
- You're following Miles?

161
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,208
He was a USAC road racing champ in '61.
He won the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

162
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:32,222
He was SCCA C class champion 3 years in a row
in this piece of shit MG he built himself.

163
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,957
We heard he's difficult.

164
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:34,943
What, Ken?

165
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,395
No, no. Ken is a puppy dog.

166
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,765
Lance, tell the man.
You raced against Ken.

167
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:41,087
I've driven more behind him
than against him.

168
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:46,068
Brumos is looking for a driver
for our number two car at Sebring.

169
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:47,293
Is that right?

170
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,481
You think your guy Miles
could make the grade?

171
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:50,959
Oh, well...

172
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:55,552
Jim, is it impotently
bloody carry on on your trunk?

173
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:58,271
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

174
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,899
To be honest, Ken was born for Sebring.

175
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:08,164
Nothing in there about my trunk
and your lovely little portmanteau.

176
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:11,226
You're holding a '62 edition of the SCCA.

177
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:16,743
You can stick this bloody sticker
where the sun never shines.

178
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:19,146
Hey. Hey, Bill.
What seems to be the problem?

179
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,146
The problem is
that Bill here is an arsehole.

180
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,763
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Yes, he does.

181
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:27,575
He really does think
that Bill is an arsehole.

182
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:29,044
I'm just doing my job here.

183
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:31,916
Bill, in my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

184
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:34,065
Something like this, there's always
the middle ground, all right?

185
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,918
- Ken's out of line, all right?
- And I'm just doing my job.

186
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:36,789
I understand you are.

187
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,154
You know how it gets on a race day.
You know that, all right?

188
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:41,259
But you're not gonna DQ us
over the trunk.

189
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,491
Happy, Bill?

190
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:06,932
I'll talk to him.
You just go and have a great day.

191
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,138
Shit.

192
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:13,616
Bulldog.

193
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,947
Do you know who that was
I was just talking to?

194
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:18,574
- Bill.
- Before that.

195
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,629
No.

196
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:22,399
- It was Dieter Voss.
- Who's that?

197
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,289
He runs Porshe, Ken.

198
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:27,888
It's a little German car company,
maybe you heard of it.

199
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,759
He wanted you to drive at Sebring,
but he heard you were difficult.

200
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,807
I thought we felt
the same way about

201
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,460
Germans.

202
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,141
Do you like losing, Ken?

203
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:53,206
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

204
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:55,502
I don't lose.

205
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,130
Without sponsors, you get no car, Ken.

206
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,840
Last I checked,
the professionals all have a car.

207
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,856
You cannot win the SCCA without one.
If you are not winning you are losing.

208
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:09,352
Don't make me lump this
at your head.

209
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:14,395
Did you bring your son all the way out here to watch
you get disqualified, or just act like a jackass?

210
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,425
That answers that.

211
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,668
Peter.

212
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,673
May I help you, gentlemen?

213
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,914
Yes, is Ken Miles here?

214
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,072
No.

215
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,566
- We need to speak to Mr. Miles.
- I'm his wife.

216
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:07,739
<i>Welcome to the 1963 World's greatest. 112
cars will be competing at this 40 lap race.</i>

217
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:11,535
Hey, Ken.
What happened to your shield?

218
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,469
New design.

219
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,143
<i>It looks like we are about to begin.</i>

220
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,410
<i>The cars are completing the roll out lap.
The green flag is out.</i>

221
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,536
<i>And they're approaching the starting lap.</i>

222
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,254
Here we go.

223
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,436
Bloody hell!

224
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,806
Learn to drive, you pillock!

225
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:45,528
So, Shelby, you miss it?

226
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:48,939
Hey, Sam.

227
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:54,714
Guy wins the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Suddenly retires. Starts selling cars.

228
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,457
It just doesn't make sense. Well,
unless the rumors are true, of course.

229
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:02,805
What rumors would those be, Sam?

230
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,367
That Carroll Shelby quit driving
'cause he lost his nerve.

231
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:14,675
I'll give it up and I'll break you
on the next turn, Bob.

232
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:28,464
Nice try, Bob

233
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,949
<i>Nice move from Ken Miles.
22 laps remaining.</i>

234
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,697
<i>It's been an incredible day
here in Willow Springs.</i>

235
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,857
<i>We've seen some exciting riding.</i>

236
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,343
<i>With only 1 lap remaining
in this 40 lap race.</i>

237
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:24,377
<i>We are coming to the final scratch.</i>

238
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:28,341
<i>Dan Gurney has been leading
the pack for the most of the...</i>

239
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,953
<i>Red Faris is off the track.</i>

240
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:36,339
<i>That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead,
followed by journeyman Ken Miles.</i>

241
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,268
Now for you, Dan.

242
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:51,108
<i>And they're coming around the last turn. Gurney is
still in the lead with Ken Miles out of dispute.</i>

243
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,802
<i>Miles is looking for an opening.</i>

244
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,020
Not yet.

245
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,029
Come on!

246
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,913
<i>Can Gurney hold him off?
The final streak.</i>

247
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,217
Not yet.

248
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,295
<i>Gurney is blocking him out.</i>

249
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,613
Now.

250
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:19,360
Nice move, Ken.

251
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,699
<i>They're wheel to wheel.</i>

252
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,303
Come on!

253
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:40,250
<i>An incredible finish for Ken Miles.
Didn't see that one coming.</i>

254
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,085
He's difficult, but good.

255
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,710
That goes for a nice coup of tea.

256
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,962
I've got the kettle on.

257
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,585
Hop in.

258
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,556
Pops, frame this.

259
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,586
Hey.

260
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,528
We did it!

261
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,256
What's wrong?

262
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:36,587
The IRS came.
They've padlocked the garage.

263
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,863
All right, Petey.

264
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,278
Couple of years ago

265
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:01,003
you said we'd a nest-egg.

266
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,460
Correct.

267
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:06,352
- A couple of years ago.
- Correct.

268
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:13,986
So, just to be clear,
we are buggered.

269
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,879
Absolutely.

270
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,390
As in totally?

271
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:29,697
As in not a bean
or a pot in which to piss.

272
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,207
Spares. Stock. All gone.
Tools. My tools are locked up in there.

273
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,658
I'll figure something out.

274
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:44,043
In 1945 our soldiers came home.

275
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,132
What was the first thing
that they did?

276
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,360
They had sex.

277
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:54,986
17 years later, those babies,
they've grown.

278
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:58,377
They've got jobs. They've got licenses.

279
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:03,825
But they do not wanna drive the same
dull 50's cars their parents drove.

280
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:09,490
You see, kids today, they want glamor.
They wanna sex appeal.

281
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,139
They wanna go fast.

282
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:12,805
Gentlemen.

283
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:16,982
It's time for the Ford Motor Company
to go racing.

284
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:20,559
We're already in racing, lacocca.

285
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:24,293
NASCAR? It's regional, sir.

286
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:26,725
If you go to the movies.

287
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:30,577
You open up a magazine you don't
see good ol' boys in Winston-Salem.

288
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:31,916
You see

289
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,809
Sophia Loren,

290
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:37,500
Monica Vitti.

291
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:43,204
James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir.

292
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,217
That's because he's a degenerate.

293
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:50,807
See?

294
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,092
God, I'd like to be a degenerate.

295
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:54,964
Just give me one second, please.

296
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,661
Is this part of it?

297
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:59,673
- Is this going anywhere, lacocca?
- Sorry, sir.

298
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:02,051
- All right. All right. That's enough.
- Sir, if you just bear waiting...

299
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,014
Turn it off! Lights!

300
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:13,320
Lee, in the last 3 years
you and your marketing team

301
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:18,432
have presided over
the worst sale slump in US history.

302
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:23,589
Why exactly should Mr. Ford listen to you?

303
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,421
Because we've been thinking wrong.

304
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:32,784
Ferrari.

305
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,677
They won 4 out of the last 5 Le Mans.

306
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,673
We need to think like Ferrari.

307
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:44,512
Ferrari makes fewer cars in a year
than we make in a day.

308
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:50,313
We spend more on toilet paper
than they do on their entire output.

309
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,763
You want us to think like them?

310
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:58,092
Enzo Ferrari will go down in history as
the greatest car manufacturer of all time.

311
00:23:58,689 --> 00:23:59,939
Why?

312
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:04,418
Is it because he built the most cars?

313
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:06,794
No.

314
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:10,249
It's because of what his cars mean.

315
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,372
Victory.

316
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,192
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.
People they...

317
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,063
They want some of that victory.

318
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:23,356
What if the Ford badge meant victory?

319
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,332
And meant it where it counts with the
first group of 17-year-olds in history.

320
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,501
- With money in their pockets.
- This would take years.

321
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:36,382
Decades to test and develop a race team
capable of taking on Ferrari.

322
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,268
Ferrari's bankrupt.

323
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:45,125
Enzo spent every lire he's got chasing
perfection, and you know something?

324
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,794
He got there.

325
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,786
But now he's broke.

326
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,717
You don't have to give up racing
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

327
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:16,957
I think I do.

328
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:21,215
I've had my fun, it's time
to put food on the table and grow up.

329
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:23,817
The garage didn't pay the pills.
Now it's locked up.

330
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:26,594
Racing doesn't pay them either
and I keep winning.

331
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,315
Yeah, because you're good.

332
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:30,866
I can't play the game.

333
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:33,429
I'm not what they call "the people person".

334
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:34,415
You don't say.

335
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:37,050
And I'm 45 years old.
Do you really think I'm gonna change?

336
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,133
I'm never gonna get the good rides.
I started too late.

337
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,354
Because you fought in a bloody war!

338
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:48,368
If you stop
you'd be bloody insufferable.

339
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:52,484
It was a quick all around the region.
It's over.

340
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:54,706
Let's look on the bright side.

341
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:58,901
Now I can get fat and old,
trim the roses and eat pork pies.

342
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:24,036
Scuzi, please.
No photos, prego.

343
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,240
Relax.

344
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,411
You gotta understand.

345
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:29,321
This is like the Mafia showing up
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

346
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,704
Kind of the opposite, actually.

347
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:34,047
If the Press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

348
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:38,354
- Lee lacocca, Ford Motor.
- Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.

349
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:41,714
Sonno queste...
Your journalist?

350
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:46,834
No, no, Mr. Iacocca.
It's our cameras, just for history.

351
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,724
Four liters Colombo engine.

352
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:57,313
One man assembles
the entire engine by himself.

353
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:01,806
Another man assembles the transmission.

354
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,831
Everything hand-built.

355
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:08,045
Benissimo.

356
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:22,424
Racing department.

357
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,461
Lee, that's him.

358
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:35,284
This merger between our companies
will form two entities.

359
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,048
Ford-Ferarri: 90% owned by Ford
who controls all production.

360
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:53,453
Secondly, Ferarri-Ford, the race team.
90% owned by Ferrari.

361
00:27:58,373 --> 00:28:02,776
In order to secure this
Ford will pay the sum...

362
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,690
10 million dollars.

363
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,196
Excuse me.

364
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,033
He will need some time to read this.

365
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:40,716
Please.

366
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,179
Understood.

367
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,696
Well done, thank you.

368
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:59,354
Only one small question.
It concerns my race program.

369
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:13,471
If I wish to race Le Mans
and you do not wish for me to race Le Mans,

370
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:15,764
Do we or do we not go?

371
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:27,137
In that highly unlikely scenario.

372
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:33,529
If we just can't agree then - yes.
I mean - no.

373
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,140
You are correct.

374
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,781
You do not go.

375
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,823
My integrity as a constructor,
as a man, as an Italian

376
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,307
is deeply insulted by your proposal.

377
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:04,116
Go back to Michigan.

378
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,684
Back to your big ugly factory.

379
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,954
Back to your big ugly factory
making its ugly little cars.

380
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,855
Tell your pig-headed boss that all his

381
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,816
smug executives are
worthless sons of whores.

382
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:36,004
Tell him he's not Henry Ford.

383
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,525
He is Henry Ford II.

384
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,311
He played us.

385
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,641
Old man Enzo had no intention
of selling to us.

386
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:16,116
He used us to up his price.

387
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:19,426
Embarrass our company,
insult your leadership.

388
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:22,313
It was a bad idea from the start.

389
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:33,179
What exactly did he say?

390
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:46,242
He said Ford makes ugly little cars,
and we make 'em in ugly factory.

391
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:51,458
He said our executives are sons of whores.

392
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,826
About me.

393
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:00,506
He called you fatster.

394
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:04,243
Pig-headed.

395
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:06,850
Go on.

396
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,369
He said you're not Henry Ford.

397
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:13,509
You're Henry Ford II.

398
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:38,496
I want the best engineers.

399
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,069
The best drivers.

400
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,367
I don't care what it costs.

401
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:51,605
We're gonna build a race car.

402
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,291
And we gonna bury
that goddamn greasy wop

403
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:04,750
a 100 feet deep
under the finish line at Le Mans.

404
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:08,448
And I will be there to watch it.

405
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,123
Here they come.
Go! Go! Go!

406
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:17,104
- Asshole!
- You're really pathetic!

407
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:18,301
I'm so sorry, girls.

408
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:22,981
Charlie, quit throwing crackers at
the girls all damn day, goddammit.

409
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:26,122
- Do I gotta deal with this?
- It's already taken care of.

410
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:28,297
Sorry about that.

411
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:31,303
So, yeah. 289 cubic inch V8.

412
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:32,204
All right.

413
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:36,582
Extensive rework of AC Ace's front end. And
a stronger rear diff to handle the torque.

414
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:38,495
How does she handle the quarter mile?

415
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:41,378
I'm not saying
you should go drag racing.

416
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:43,612
But quarter mile is 13.6.

417
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:45,650
- Is that good?
- That's real good.

418
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:48,413
He sold that same car
3 times this week.

419
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,734
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

420
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:53,990
Yeah, mister, you just bought yourself
one hell of a sport car.

421
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,124
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna... Phil.

422
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:01,062
I'm gonna pass you off to my colleague
here, he gonna take care of you.

423
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:02,866
Phil, Wyatt.

424
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:04,885
I'll steal him for one second.

425
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,753
You take the payment.

426
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:09,990
Whatever you do, do not let him take
that car, that's Jeff Blitzer's car.

427
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,999
And Frank Collins's.
And Steve McQueen's.

428
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:14,375
Shit, I forgot about McQueen.

429
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,414
Morning, can I help?

430
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:23,244
Carroll Shelby.

431
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,283
Maybe.

432
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:28,130
Lee lacocca, Ford Motor.

433
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,722
What's with the wrench?

434
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,229
That? Long story.

435
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:39,965
We are just goin'
from strength to strength here, Lee.

436
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,187
Terrific sales.
We're killing it on the track.

437
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,669
Now I know we owe Ford
for the last batch of engines...

438
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:51,119
Mr. Shelby, I can assure you I'm not here for the
money that you might owe Ford for spare parts.

439
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,239
You're not?

440
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,595
No. I'm not.

441
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:57,421
Okay.

442
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,417
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ford,
Henry Ford II.

443
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,546
Suppose, hypothetically,

444
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:07,712
he wanted his company
to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

445
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,386
You're one of the only Americans
that's ever done it.

446
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:15,187
I'm wondering, what's it take?

447
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:20,083
Hypothetically?

448
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:22,533
Hypothetically.

449
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,877
It take something money can't buy.

450
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:28,590
Money can buy speed.

451
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,696
It isn't about speed, Lee.

452
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:37,829
It's not just like those other tracks where
all you do is turn to the left for 4 hours.

453
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:43,645
To win that race you need a car that's light
enough to do 200 on the straight areas,

454
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:47,396
but strong enough to keep that up
for 3000 miles without a break.

455
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,456
Not just the best car y'all ever made,

456
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:54,890
but better than anything that Enzo Ferrari
shows up with that year.

457
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,772
And that just gets you to the green flag,
that's where your problems really start.

458
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:04,029
- Is everything okay?
- Go away.

459
00:37:11,324 --> 00:37:13,371
So, you're saying it's challenging.

460
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:18,121
Look, it's not even a track, Lee.

461
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,469
Le Mans's 8.5 miles of country road

462
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:25,324
that's narrow, ungraded. It's rough.

463
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:28,652
There's no camber on the turns. No rails.

464
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:33,793
You gotta do that for 24 hours.

465
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,734
24 hours, Lee.

466
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:40,079
That means night.

467
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:43,363
Half of that race is in the dark,
you can't see shit.

468
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,053
Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.

469
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:51,874
Drivers stumblin' around the track
pourin' blood.

470
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:56,438
Maybe one of them is your friend.
Maybe he's on fire.

471
00:37:58,244 --> 00:38:00,495
You're exhausted. You're hungry.

472
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:03,557
Can't remember your name.
What country you're in.

473
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:08,024
And all of a sudden you realize
you're doing 198 on the straight.

474
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:13,460
And if anything goes wrong.

475
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:17,286
You blow a gasket, 5 cent washer.

476
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:19,769
That's it. Whole thing's over.

477
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:22,263
Ferrari wins again.

478
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:26,775
Just like it won last year. The year
before that, and the year before that.

479
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:34,030
Yeah, it's challenging.

480
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:40,477
You don't think that Ford Motor Company can build
the greatest race car the world's ever seen?

481
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:44,984
You think that we are
incapable of winning event like that?

482
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:47,926
Even if we had a brilliant partner?

483
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:53,762
Even if we wrote a blank check?

484
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:04,143
What I'm saying is
you can't buy a win, Lee,

485
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:11,166
but maybe you could buy the guy
who gets you a shot.

486
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,564
The new transmission.
Axles, shocks all around.

487
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,398
Ditch the body and the tires

488
00:39:33,398 --> 00:39:35,553
and you have yourself a contender.

489
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:38,153
Anything on this beauty
that does work?

490
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:40,880
The mirrors are outstanding.

491
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,694
I saw that walking up.

492
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:47,800
So, what?
You're just passing or evening stroll?

493
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,643
Actually, bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

494
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:55,212
You gonna build a car
to beat old man Ferrari?

495
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,357
With Ford. With a Ford?

496
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:00,522
Correct.

497
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,685
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

498
00:40:02,685 --> 00:40:04,725
Two, three hundred years?

499
00:40:04,878 --> 00:40:06,524
90 days.

500
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,295
All right, so, let's just look
at this for a moment.

501
00:40:13,963 --> 00:40:17,965
And for argument's sake, let's just
forget about the whole 90 day thing.

502
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:21,955
Let's just pretend you got all the money
in the world and all the time in the world.

503
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:23,871
I like the sound of that.

504
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:28,152
You think that Ford
are gonna let you build

505
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:33,867
the car that you want
the way you want it?

506
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:36,781
The Ford Motor Company?

507
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:39,792
Those guys?

508
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,810
Have you ever been to Detroit?
They have floors and floors of lawyers,

509
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,812
and millions of marketing guys,
and they all gonna wanna meet you,

510
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,632
all of them gonna wanna get their photo
taken with the great Carroll Shelby,

511
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:53,631
and they gonna kiss your arse, and then
they gonna go back to their lovely offices,

512
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:58,784
and they would work on new ways to screw
you. Why? Because they can't help it.

513
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:04,364
Because they just wanna please their boss, who wants
to please his boss, who wants to please his boss.

514
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:11,746
And they hate themselves for it, but deep down,
who they hate even more, the guys like you,

515
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:17,507
because you're not like them, because you don't
think like them, because you're different.

516
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:20,522
It's coming straight from the Deuce.

517
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,009
He's serious.

518
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:26,311
They gonna put real money behind it.

519
00:41:28,762 --> 00:41:30,568
I bet they are.

520
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:35,368
You know why?
Because someone, and I'm not saying who.

521
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:41,320
Someone has told them
that this is actually possible.

522
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:45,428
Look, this Sunday at Cloverfield,
they're launching a new Mustang.

523
00:41:45,428 --> 00:41:47,396
I'm gonna announce the race program.

524
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:50,060
Just come on by.

525
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:54,659
Come take a look.
Listen to my speech.

526
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:58,286
I'm making a speech.
Bring Peter, he'll love it.

527
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:01,950
I'll watch you.

528
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:05,626
See you Sunday.

529
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:14,091
Dad, look at that.

530
00:42:18,046 --> 00:42:20,754
Ford Mustang. What do you think?

531
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:26,161
I think it's a secretary's car.

532
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,357
I like it.

533
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,820
Excuse me. Excuse me.

534
00:42:35,282 --> 00:42:37,302
Would you mind not to do that?

535
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:40,223
Sorry.

536
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:47,279
- Is this your son?
- Yes, it is.

537
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:50,755
Would you ask him
to keep his hands off the paintwork?

538
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,315
No, no, Petey, you're okay.
Who are you?

539
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:57,177
Leo Beebe, Senior Executive Vice President,
Ford Motor Company.

540
00:42:57,177 --> 00:43:00,173
I am responsible
for the launch of the Mustang.

541
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:02,858
At least now we know who's responsible.

542
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:04,695
- Don't get me wrong, Lenny.
- Leo.

543
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:09,158
It looks fantastic,
but inside it's a lump of lard

544
00:43:09,158 --> 00:43:10,596
dressed up to fool the public.

545
00:43:10,596 --> 00:43:15,583
My advice is: lose the Inline 6
and that idiotic 3 speeds,

546
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,222
shorten wheelbase.
Somehow lose half a ton.

547
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:21,363
- And lower the price.
- Dad.

548
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,526
But even then
I'd still choose the Chevy Chevelle.

549
00:43:25,765 --> 00:43:28,361
That's a fucking terrible car.

550
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:31,515
How are we doing up there, Steve?

551
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,889
There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby.

552
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:35,689
Oh, yeah.

553
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,804
You mind if I take a shot
at the landing?

554
00:43:39,461 --> 00:43:42,980
Come on, I mean it. I flew a B-29s
outta San Antonio back in '44.

555
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,601
- Are you kidding me?
- I did.

556
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:45,959
Okay.

557
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,536
Carroll, what are you doing?

558
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:48,814
- Does he know how to fly?
- Carroll.

559
00:43:48,814 --> 00:43:51,170
I had an instructor
who'd tell me

560
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,001
Looking down I would say
it's probably a good time to buckle up.

561
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:56,251
Do everybody a favor
and stay on the ground.

562
00:43:56,712 --> 00:43:58,526
That's a true story.

563
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,141
This is the car
you never expected for Detroit.

564
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,470
All right. Let's go.

565
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:13,992
Not staying, Ken?

566
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:16,781
It's a bloody pig in a poke, isn't it.

567
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,325
There they come now.

568
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:25,167
Wait, are they crashing?

569
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,932
Who is the pilot?

570
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,199
My guess, Peter...

571
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,877
Someone we know.

572
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:36,800
Everything all right up there?

573
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:38,074
No!

574
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:39,883
Hang on.

575
00:44:39,883 --> 00:44:42,233
Shit!

576
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:48,333
I'll tell you what,
that's like riding a bike.

577
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:57,678
Talking about making an entrance.
Good grief.

578
00:44:58,148 --> 00:44:59,856
- Shelby!
- Over here!

579
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:03,187
Hey out there.

580
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:05,618
Can we have an autograph, sir?

581
00:45:05,618 --> 00:45:06,996
Shelby, this is Roy Lunn.

582
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,742
Ol' Roy here is developing
the prototype over in England.

583
00:45:09,895 --> 00:45:11,799
Hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

584
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,591
Welcome to madhouse, Shelby. Ford willed up
the entire executive committee for this one.

585
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:17,712
Hold that thought.

586
00:45:18,703 --> 00:45:20,703
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

587
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:22,837
Did you like that?
Hey, Peter, how are you doing?

588
00:45:22,837 --> 00:45:24,295
- Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

589
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:26,874
Are you building a car
so you can beat Ferrari?

590
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,426
Well, we're gonna go to Le Mans,
that's for sure.

591
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:32,515
And if get across that finish line first
we gonna win.

592
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:36,429
Carroll, allow me to introduce Leo Beebe,
Senior Vice President Ford Motor.

593
00:45:36,774 --> 00:45:37,497
Oh, sure, yeah.

594
00:45:37,497 --> 00:45:38,739
- Please Mr. Beebe.
- Thank you for coming.

595
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,810
Say hello to Ken Miles
and his son Peter.

596
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,622
- We...
- Right.

597
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:44,013
We met.

598
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:47,673
Didn't we?

599
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:52,235
I'll take Petey for some pop.

600
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:54,332
Good luck with these guys, Shel.

601
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:56,421
- Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

602
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:58,493
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

603
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,932
You two had a chance
to talk on the plane?

604
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:07,450
Yeah, Carroll, why don't we just...
Step this way for a second...

605
00:46:14,376 --> 00:46:16,411
Look, it's pro forma.
It's window dressing.

606
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:20,141
But there's gotta be a sense
of getting the tape between you and...

607
00:46:21,103 --> 00:46:23,242
- No. I don't.
- The group.

608
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,373
The group?

609
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,472
Senior creatives, Carroll.
Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.

610
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:29,907
I'm confused, Lee.

611
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:32,991
'Cause up until this moment
right now I was comfortable.

612
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:35,676
Why don't you take a look
out there, Carroll?

613
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:37,394
What do you see?

614
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:40,482
Do you know what I see?
I see a machine.

615
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:43,928
I see ten thousand moving parts
moving, hopefully, in harmony.

616
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:46,960
And it's my job to make it so.
It's my job to guide you through it.

617
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,619
I'm here to help you, Carroll.
But you gotta trust me.

618
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:53,660
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll.

619
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:56,105
Do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

620
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:58,687
Please, welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.

621
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:00,287
Gotta go.

622
00:47:06,943 --> 00:47:09,333
- What did he say?
- He gets the drill.

623
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:13,854
Thank you.

624
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:16,266
If my Daddy was here today

625
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:21,153
he'd tell me to sit on down
and leave the yackin' to the college boys.

626
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:24,021
Like my cars, I'll make this fast.

627
00:47:26,165 --> 00:47:28,841
When I was 10 years old,
my Pops said, son

628
00:47:29,422 --> 00:47:33,383
it's a truly lucky man who knows
what he wants to do in this world.

629
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:36,146
'Cause that man will never work
a day in his life.

630
00:47:36,892 --> 00:47:41,975
But there are a few, a precious few, and
hell I don't know if they're lucky or not,

631
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:45,640
but there are a few people
who find something they have to do.

632
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,573
Something obsesses them.

633
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:53,499
Something if they can't do it's gonna
drive them clean outta their mind.

634
00:47:54,463 --> 00:47:56,151
I'm that guy.

635
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:59,807
And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.

636
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:02,611
His name...

637
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:07,088
His name is Mr. Henry Ford.

638
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:15,516
And together we gonna build
the fastest automobile in the world.

639
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:21,920
And we gonna make history too at Le Mans.

640
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:25,683
Let's go.

641
00:48:26,495 --> 00:48:31,041
My name is Carroll Shelby.
I build race cars.

642
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:56,271
No. Whatever it is - no.

643
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,218
No.

644
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:01,542
30 minutes.

645
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:05,229
I'm spent, I wanna have a bath.

646
00:49:05,229 --> 00:49:08,713
You gonna wanna see this.
Trust me.

647
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:12,982
30 minutes.
I'll have you back for meatloaf and gravy.

648
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:18,412
- 30 minutes.
- Yeah.

649
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:38,769
Bloody hell.

650
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:46,410
Fresh off the plane from England.

651
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:52,001
She's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

652
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,327
Come on.

653
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:17,512
Interesting.

654
00:50:34,194 --> 00:50:35,315
Well?

655
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:38,037
- It's awful.
- It's worse than awful.

656
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:41,345
It doesn't track.
The 3rd gear is too high,

657
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:45,341
torque is not reaching the road.

658
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:49,248
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

659
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:51,736
At over 140 it thinks it's...

660
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,633
- Airplane.
- Yeah.

661
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,576
It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.

662
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:01,018
Anything else?

663
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,270
One second.

664
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:39,561
You were back late last night.

665
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:41,140
Yeah.

666
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,924
Were you working?

667
00:51:50,129 --> 00:51:52,067
Didn't go anyplace?

668
00:51:52,557 --> 00:51:53,867
What?

669
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:58,628
I'm asking, did you go
anyplace last night?

670
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:02,155
Mollie.

671
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:04,305
It's a simple question.

672
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,001
And I answered, didn't I?

673
00:52:08,107 --> 00:52:09,792
What was the answer?

674
00:52:11,617 --> 00:52:13,425
Is something up, luv?

675
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:15,890
What are you doing?

676
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,151
What are you doing?
You're driving very fast.

677
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:19,774
Am I? Am I?

678
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:21,677
Yes, you are!

679
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:25,245
Bloody hell!
What are you...? What is this?

680
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,206
You tell me 'cause I don't know.

681
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:29,516
What? Slow down!

682
00:52:30,352 --> 00:52:31,929
Mollie!

683
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:37,656
Please! Slow it down! All right?
You're trying to kill us or something?

684
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:40,490
- I thought we love this shit.
- What?

685
00:52:41,671 --> 00:52:42,569
Bloody hell!

686
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:45,806
- It's a bit of racing fun, no?
- No, it's not the same!

687
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:48,173
I think it's thrilling!

688
00:52:48,729 --> 00:52:49,920
All right.

689
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:52,384
I saw you, all right?

690
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:55,838
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

691
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:57,505
Okay. Shit. Okay.
Slow down.

692
00:52:57,505 --> 00:52:59,580
All then all day you got
that stupid look on your face.

693
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,312
Mollie, slow down!
You're too close in.

694
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:07,530
Mollie, pull on the brakes right now!

695
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,720
Not until you tell me what's going on!

696
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,190
All right. I went to look at a car.

697
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,949
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

698
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,404
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

699
00:53:17,596 --> 00:53:20,068
There's a corner coming,
you better hold on.

700
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:23,362
Are you gonna lift your foot off
at all through this?

701
00:53:23,362 --> 00:53:25,112
No. 'Cause I like that clean race inline.

702
00:53:25,112 --> 00:53:27,030
Slow down!

703
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:34,071
Okay. Shel offered me a job.
Ford owns a car

704
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:36,328
that they wanna put up
against the Ferrari.

705
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:40,110
- You told me you were done!
- I didn't say yes!

706
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:42,905
- Slow down!
- You told me you quit!

707
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:46,364
- I don't understand.
- You fat and old you said!

708
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:48,533
Fat and old!

709
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:55,093
- That's what you told me!
- I don't understand.

710
00:53:55,453 --> 00:54:00,371
Are you upset because I said I was done
or because I looked at a race car?

711
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:03,829
Just don't lie to me again!

712
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:08,403
Don't make it a secret,
what you want or what you feel

713
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:11,721
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy!

714
00:54:13,344 --> 00:54:15,936
Mol, I don't even know what I feel.

715
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,635
If you do this

716
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,752
they better be paying you this time.

717
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,494
'Cause I can't work any more hours
and look after Peter.

718
00:54:34,494 --> 00:54:38,291
The IRS has the garage.
I'm not losing my home.

719
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:40,768
It's 200 a day

720
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,035
plus expenses.

721
00:54:47,502 --> 00:54:49,191
Are you shitting me?

722
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:51,778
But, I haven't decided.

723
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:56,547
200 dollars a day?

724
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:00,512
Are you nuts?

725
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:25,506
This is ridiculous.

726
00:55:27,773 --> 00:55:30,912
Grabbing air. That's the problem.

727
00:55:31,782 --> 00:55:35,471
Over 90 air's getting in, not getting out.

728
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:37,558
It's the nose.
I can feel it in the wheel.

729
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:39,964
Mr. Miles, if there's a problem
the computer will find it.

730
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,734
Charlie, get some scotch tape
and a ball of wool.

731
00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:45,627
All right.

732
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:50,806
Good, good. Now let's just
get all of this junk out.

733
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:52,581
All right, Pops?

734
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:58,608
What are they doing?

735
00:55:58,765 --> 00:56:00,913
Making the car faster.

736
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:10,717
There! Right there!
Airflow's getting stuck.

737
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,273
I see it. Yarn blows straight up.
Front's lifting. Damn he's right.

738
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:33,283
This car wants to go faster. I feel it.

739
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:37,841
Any lighter we're getting fragile. We took
70 pounds out of her in the last week.

740
00:56:37,919 --> 00:56:41,040
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

741
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,923
- So put in a bigger engine.
- Where we gonna put it? On the roof?

742
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:51,508
Managed to make it 52 pounds lighter
than the NASCAR unit.

743
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,468
All new aluminum cylinder heads.

744
00:56:59,263 --> 00:57:02,552
Vibration dampers. Water pump.
Smaller valves.

745
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:04,689
We call it "The Beast".

746
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:09,309
I see why, but how is it gonna fit
without the redesigning the engine pit?

747
00:57:09,353 --> 00:57:11,772
It certainly wasn't easy.
Good Morning, gentlemen. Mr. Shelby.

748
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:16,381
So, you already put that in a GT-40?

749
00:57:17,024 --> 00:57:18,987
I'm afraid we have.

750
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:26,136
I'll be damned.

751
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,624
It's heavy, of course.

752
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:30,414
Problems with the handling. Especially
the stopping. I can show you the data.

753
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,466
What problems?

754
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:33,964
Can I borrow that?

755
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:35,883
Just a second.

756
00:57:36,043 --> 00:57:38,074
Ken! Ken!

757
00:57:38,682 --> 00:57:40,752
Perhaps we ought to check with HQ
before you can drive...

758
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:43,242
- What did you say?
- We should ask...

759
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:45,120
All right.

760
00:57:57,385 --> 00:57:59,827
Mr. Shelby. Welcome to Dearborn.

761
00:57:59,827 --> 00:58:03,820
What are you doing at a test track? You're
gonna get Castrol all over that nice suit.

762
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:07,744
I want to hear your thoughts on a few
planning decisions. Personnel for Le Mans.

763
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:10,787
It's a hell of a line up.
Ken Miles. Phil Hill.

764
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,914
Chris Amon. Bruce McLaren.

765
00:58:12,914 --> 00:58:15,389
Hill's a lock. Amon. McLaren too.

766
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:17,211
We're less sure about Miles.

767
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:21,827
We like Richie Ginter.
Masten Gregory. Bob Bondurant?

768
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:27,315
You want the best driver for the car,
who understands the machine, that's Ken.

769
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:30,026
Yes.

770
00:58:30,435 --> 00:58:33,765
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

771
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:37,628
I may not get the finer points of racing
Mr. Shelby, but I do know people.

772
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:42,260
Miles is... He's a beatnik.
He dresses like one.

773
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,798
Ford means reliability.
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

774
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:50,675
Get it up! Get it up!

775
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,012
What's the lap record here, Burt?

776
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:57,392
1.58.

777
00:58:58,332 --> 00:58:59,758
1.50. Dead.

778
00:58:59,758 --> 00:59:03,281
A beatnik? That man landed
a busted tank on the beach at D-Day

779
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:05,554
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

780
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:07,655
A beatnik?

781
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:11,214
Lee here asked me a while back,
what's the one thing money can't buy.

782
00:59:12,313 --> 00:59:13,518
I'll tell you what it is.

783
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:16,218
A pure racer behind the wheel of your car.

784
00:59:16,802 --> 00:59:18,527
That's Ken Miles.

785
00:59:20,245 --> 00:59:22,277
Be that as it may,

786
00:59:22,538 --> 00:59:25,002
we think he may be too pure.

787
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:35,751
Carrol, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

788
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,187
Too pure?

789
00:59:39,104 --> 00:59:40,787
What exactly does that mean?

790
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:43,663
Means he's all about himself.

791
00:59:44,857 --> 00:59:49,036
ABC puts a microphone under his nose.
Perhaps there's a detail he dislikes.

792
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:50,427
Millions watching.

793
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:53,009
Do you trust him not to put out
the wrong message?

794
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:55,484
He can get it.
Clean cut all American poster boy.

795
00:59:55,484 --> 00:59:57,862
And stick him behind the wheel.
Teach him what to say.

796
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,256
Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the car
if all you wanna do is lose.

797
01:00:01,576 --> 01:00:04,577
So, you don't agree with us
on this issue?

798
01:00:06,913 --> 01:00:09,240
I'm saying you're gotta trust me
on this one.

799
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:12,705
Carroll, with marketing concerns,
that's just not possible.

800
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:18,041
Put a Ford type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

801
01:00:18,267 --> 01:00:20,366
That's the Ford way.

802
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:29,142
<i>Yet another championship win for Ferrari...</i>

803
01:00:32,034 --> 01:00:33,576
Ferrari wins.

804
01:00:36,893 --> 01:00:38,571
Wedges. We have wedges.

805
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:40,155
Good. Good.

806
01:00:40,716 --> 01:00:42,040
Perfect.

807
01:00:42,982 --> 01:00:44,597
- 40?
- Yup.

808
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,325
Hey, boss.

809
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,308
You got a passport?

810
01:00:58,308 --> 01:01:00,336
- What's that?
- Sign that. Get a passport.

811
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,663
Get it back to me by Friday.

812
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:04,848
Boys, I'm going to France.

813
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:07,438
Phil.

814
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,730
Ken, can I get a word?

815
01:01:18,224 --> 01:01:19,564
Can I take this?

816
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:26,392
Do you know why Ford named it the GT-40?
Why they put the 40 on there?

817
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:28,281
- No.
- Regulations.

818
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:33,973
We gotta be 40″ high
to make the ground clearance requirements.

819
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,686
No more, no less.
They measure it before every race.

820
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:42,190
Problem is, that with that height
it's too much drag under the car.

821
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:46,118
We got a solution. Wedges.
We put wedges in...

822
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:47,803
You're not coming next week.

823
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:52,992
You're not coming, Ken.

824
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:58,269
We're taking McLaren.
Chris Amon. Phil Hill

825
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,291
and Bob Bondurant.

826
01:02:01,903 --> 01:02:03,459
This is Ford's call.

827
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:09,651
It is their opinion that you're not a good
image, so you cannot drive their race car.

828
01:02:11,084 --> 01:02:13,964
Putting aside the fact that you made
that car whatever the hell it is,

829
01:02:15,909 --> 01:02:18,213
and you're the best man I got
behind the wheel.

830
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:39,495
I'm gonna re-route the oil line.

831
01:02:39,495 --> 01:02:43,360
If there's spillage it could drip
onto the rear near side disc.

832
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,154
Ken.

833
01:02:44,154 --> 01:02:49,295
Tell the boys to watch
their pace come sunrise.

834
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:53,238
The gearbox will overheat.

835
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:13,776
Ken, race is starting soon.
Want it on the radio?

836
01:03:14,036 --> 01:03:15,713
Not unless you do.

837
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:44,573
<i>...but it's still the Number 2 car driven by Chris Amon. In
third place is the Number 1 Ford driven by Bruce McLaren.</i>

838
01:03:44,573 --> 01:03:47,175
<i>A tremendously bad start for the Ford GT.</i>

839
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:54,318
<i>3:43 for lap for car Number 2 Ford. I think it's
a little bit quick for this stage of the game.</i>

840
01:03:54,937 --> 01:03:56,961
Racing too hot?

841
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:09,410
<i>Another Ford has come in to the pit to see
it pushed into the pit by the mechanic.</i>

842
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:13,994
Head gasket.
The Car is not a moon rocket.

843
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:21,660
<i>Leading Number 20 Ferrari of Michael Fahr.
Fords running one, two, three, how about that?</i>

844
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,264
Too soon. Surely too soon.

845
01:04:41,813 --> 01:04:47,519
<i>There is a big story, the lead Ford driven
by a Rickie Getzer with gearbox trouble.</i>

846
01:04:47,943 --> 01:04:52,500
Gearbox. I told them to be gentle with it.

847
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,787
Who's there?

848
01:05:10,165 --> 01:05:12,388
What's that you're listening to?

849
01:05:12,907 --> 01:05:15,033
Some race over in France.

850
01:05:17,971 --> 01:05:19,486
Exciting?

851
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:22,501
Not really paying much attention.

852
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:42,145
It's not exactly Champagne.

853
01:05:44,404 --> 01:05:46,628
Just got bubbles.

854
01:06:15,365 --> 01:06:17,274
Thanks, Mollie.

855
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,558
Grace?

856
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:11,926
Yes, sir?

857
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,794
I will sent him right in. Thank you.

858
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,286
Mr. Shelby, Mr. Ford will see you now.

859
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:23,191
All right.

860
01:07:27,379 --> 01:07:29,335
This way, Mr. Shelby.

861
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:41,690
Mr. Ford, gentlemen.

862
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:43,526
Shelby.

863
01:07:56,071 --> 01:08:03,128
Give me one reason why I don't fire everyone
associated with this abomination, starting with you.

864
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:10,955
Well, sir.

865
01:08:11,556 --> 01:08:16,741
I was thinking about that very question as I
sat out there in your lovely waiting room.

866
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:25,382
As I was sitting there I watched that little red
folder right there go through 4 pairs of hands

867
01:08:26,723 --> 01:08:28,488
before it got to you.

868
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:33,242
Of course, I don't include the 22
or so other Ford employees

869
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:36,961
who probably poked at it before it
made its way up to the 19th floor.

870
01:08:38,135 --> 01:08:42,964
With all due respect, sir,
you can't win a race by committee.

871
01:08:44,392 --> 01:08:46,494
You need one man in charge.

872
01:08:46,674 --> 01:08:51,591
Now, the good news is, as I see it,
is that even with the all extra weight

873
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:57,871
we still managed to put ol' Mr. Ferrari
exactly where we want him.

874
01:08:58,183 --> 01:08:59,643
Did we?

875
01:08:59,825 --> 01:09:01,383
Oh, yes.

876
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,818
Expand.

877
01:09:05,495 --> 01:09:06,764
Well.

878
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,035
Sure, we haven't...

879
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:12,951
We haven't worked out
how to corner yet.

880
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:18,269
Or stay cool. Or stay on the ground.

881
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:20,515
And a lot of stuff broke.

882
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:24,136
In fact, the only thing that didn't break
was the brakes.

883
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:29,457
Right now we don't even know if our
paint job will last the whole 24 hours.

884
01:09:35,027 --> 01:09:40,983
But our last lap, we clocked 218 mph
down the Mulsanne straight.

885
01:09:41,266 --> 01:09:44,640
Now, in all his years of racing

886
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:49,252
ol' Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

887
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:53,461
And now he knows without a doubt,

888
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,115
we're faster than he is.

889
01:10:00,312 --> 01:10:04,715
Even with the wrong driver.
And all the committees.

890
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:12,656
And that's what he's thinking about while
he's sitting in Modena, Italy right now.

891
01:10:14,323 --> 01:10:16,517
That man is scared to death

892
01:10:17,358 --> 01:10:22,030
that this year you actually
might be smart enough to start trusting me.

893
01:10:24,562 --> 01:10:26,163
So, yeah.

894
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:30,915
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

895
01:10:34,225 --> 01:10:36,359
You're welcome.

896
01:10:53,427 --> 01:10:55,250
Come here.

897
01:11:02,476 --> 01:11:04,907
You see that little building down there?

898
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:10,972
In WW2 three out of five US bombers
rolled off that line.

899
01:11:13,194 --> 01:11:17,933
You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?
Think again.

900
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:22,025
This isn't the first time
Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe.

901
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:26,531
We know how to do more
than push paper.

902
01:11:28,606 --> 01:11:32,202
And there is one man
running this company.

903
01:11:33,613 --> 01:11:35,765
You report to him.

904
01:11:36,342 --> 01:11:38,172
You understand me?

905
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,076
Yes, sir.

906
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:43,864
Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.

907
01:11:46,434 --> 01:11:48,209
Thank you, sir.

908
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:23,225
You were right. It's a gearbox.

909
01:12:23,894 --> 01:12:25,591
We ran too hot.

910
01:12:26,403 --> 01:12:30,317
Three out of four of 'em broke.
Rod blew on other one.

911
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,283
We're goin' back, Ken.

912
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:44,252
They told me I have
a <i>carte Blanche</i> this time.

913
01:12:45,619 --> 01:12:48,365
I looked up,
it's French for "horse shit".

914
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:52,344
I know they gonna squeeze our nuts any
way they can as soon as they work out how.

915
01:12:55,272 --> 01:12:57,404
The ice cream's melting.

916
01:12:59,573 --> 01:13:01,464
All right. Hey, Ken.

917
01:13:02,663 --> 01:13:04,888
You want me to apologize?

918
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,147
You want me to beg?

919
01:13:09,147 --> 01:13:12,882
I don't know, let's try it out.
Let's see how that feels.

920
01:13:19,267 --> 01:13:23,402
Ken, I'm sorry. Sincerely.

921
01:13:27,233 --> 01:13:31,615
Do you have any idea the kind of shit that I
had to eat just to get 4 wheels on that grid?

922
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:34,161
No. You don't, 'cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

923
01:13:34,361 --> 01:13:35,729
Now, knock it off, Ken!

924
01:13:35,729 --> 01:13:38,784
We got work to do,
and this car ain't gonna build itself.

925
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,901
Okay. All right.

926
01:14:01,908 --> 01:14:03,407
Come here!

927
01:14:03,825 --> 01:14:05,706
Bloody car salesman.

928
01:14:05,706 --> 01:14:07,217
Shit!

929
01:14:09,332 --> 01:14:11,473
Come on. Now you're gonna get this.

930
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:17,219
Get off me!

931
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,239
Come here!

932
01:14:48,504 --> 01:14:49,820
Mollie, darling.

933
01:14:50,435 --> 01:14:51,872
Yes, luv?

934
01:14:51,872 --> 01:14:53,991
Could you give me a pop, please?

935
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:56,345
Yes, luv.

936
01:14:57,813 --> 01:14:59,891
- Do you want one too, Shelby?
- No.

937
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:02,166
- Yes, please, Mollie.
- No, Mollie. No.

938
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:05,687
He can get his own. Just for me, please.

939
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:13,626
How long has that been?

940
01:15:14,383 --> 01:15:17,002
It's gotta be
three or four years at least.

941
01:15:17,628 --> 01:15:18,728
Riverside.

942
01:15:18,728 --> 01:15:23,155
Yeah, the SCCA Divisional Championship.
You broke my finger.

943
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:25,771
What was that?

944
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:29,422
Nippy...
Nippy bloody thing?

945
01:15:29,631 --> 01:15:31,231
You did on the arm that thing.

946
01:15:31,231 --> 01:15:32,967
Yeah. I call that "The Llama bite."

947
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:34,416
You named it.

948
01:15:35,507 --> 01:15:37,957
Where'd you learn that?
From the girl scouts?

949
01:15:38,157 --> 01:15:39,706
You wanna go again?

950
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:41,162
Here you go.

951
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:43,693
- You're an angel.
- Thank you.

952
01:15:43,912 --> 01:15:45,485
My pleasure.

953
01:15:46,293 --> 01:15:50,181
I'm about to go to the grocery store.
Anything you think you'll need?

954
01:15:51,726 --> 01:15:57,457
Ice cream. Ice cream would be good.
And... bread.

955
01:15:58,789 --> 01:15:59,692
All right.

956
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,950
No, I'm good. Thank you.

957
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,826
Thanks, Mol.

958
01:16:04,729 --> 01:16:06,750
You still taking those for you ticker?

959
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:09,409
Only because they're so delicious.

960
01:16:10,697 --> 01:16:12,598
Go to hell.

961
01:16:19,904 --> 01:16:21,561
Get it up!

962
01:16:37,732 --> 01:16:39,103
Sam.

963
01:16:40,214 --> 01:16:42,114
Hey, Peter. Come here.

964
01:17:00,801 --> 01:17:04,883
There's still a lag when I hit the gas.
Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.

965
01:17:04,883 --> 01:17:07,947
Charlie, get a Holley carb
we're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.

966
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:12,842
Three weeks to Daytona
and it still feels like a bag of squirrels.

967
01:17:12,842 --> 01:17:15,645
Brake heat.
That's a whole different ball game.

968
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:18,674
All right, Petey.
Let's go for that ride.

969
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:28,751
What are you doing?

970
01:17:30,008 --> 01:17:33,349
See that crack?
That's my marker for turn 8.

971
01:17:36,247 --> 01:17:37,969
To slow down?

972
01:17:39,105 --> 01:17:41,537
Push of brakes and downshift.

973
01:17:43,637 --> 01:17:46,049
But you'll be going a 150 mph.

974
01:17:46,847 --> 01:17:48,085
Yeah.

975
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:49,974
So how do you see it?

976
01:17:49,974 --> 01:17:55,702
You go fast, but as the car speeds up
everything else slows down.

977
01:17:55,702 --> 01:18:00,145
You don't do that.
You do this. All right?

978
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:02,702
And then you see everything.

979
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:06,725
Do you set other markers?

980
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:11,554
Indeed I do. Lot of them.

981
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:17,968
'Cause you can't just push the car hard
the whole way?

982
01:18:17,968 --> 01:18:19,018
That's right.

983
01:18:19,018 --> 01:18:25,205
You have to be kind to the car. You feel
the poor thing groaning underneath you.

984
01:18:26,153 --> 01:18:31,754
If you're gonna push a piece of machinery to
the limit and expect it to hold together,

985
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,113
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

986
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:44,331
Look out there.
Out there is the perfect line.

987
01:18:46,474 --> 01:18:48,012
No mistakes.

988
01:18:48,387 --> 01:18:51,082
Every gear change. Every corner.

989
01:18:52,381 --> 01:18:53,922
Perfect.

990
01:18:55,126 --> 01:18:56,813
You see it?

991
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:02,062
I think so.

992
01:19:03,742 --> 01:19:05,547
Most people can't.

993
01:19:06,586 --> 01:19:09,514
Most people don't even know
it's out there. But it is.

994
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,349
It's there.

995
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,910
You want some ice cream?

996
01:19:19,769 --> 01:19:21,130
Yeah.

997
01:19:22,209 --> 01:19:23,638
Come on then.

998
01:19:23,784 --> 01:19:25,881
- You know what this marker is?
- What?

999
01:19:25,989 --> 01:19:28,617
That one.
Pull the finger. You'll find out.

1000
01:19:50,221 --> 01:19:52,271
How much longer
before he comes in?

1001
01:19:52,953 --> 01:19:56,134
We change drivers every 4 hours,
so about 10 minutes.

1002
01:19:56,134 --> 01:19:59,201
Hang on. You're saying Beebe is
a 100 % in charge now?

1003
01:19:59,201 --> 01:20:01,441
Yes. And he wants Miles gone.

1004
01:20:01,734 --> 01:20:03,530
Look, it is personal with this guy.

1005
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,132
Yes. Yes, the leverage
to stick it to you.

1006
01:20:06,132 --> 01:20:08,960
He and the Deuce are flying there tomorrow.
He's gonna tell you in person.

1007
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,463
All he is hoping for
is that you lose your cool.

1008
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:13,562
It's time to let this go.

1009
01:20:13,562 --> 01:20:16,295
You cannot destroy the whole thing,
not for one goddamn guy.

1010
01:20:16,295 --> 01:20:18,173
- Sure I can.
- But why?

1011
01:20:18,173 --> 01:20:21,421
'Cause while we're here talking,
he's out there getting it done.

1012
01:20:29,709 --> 01:20:31,362
Oh, shit!

1013
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,660
He's got brake fail.

1014
01:20:53,674 --> 01:20:56,344
- Get him out!
- Peter! Go inside.

1015
01:20:56,845 --> 01:20:58,264
Just stay there!

1016
01:20:58,559 --> 01:21:00,522
- Ken!
- Get him out!

1017
01:21:02,397 --> 01:21:04,869
- Hurry!
- Ken!

1018
01:21:12,124 --> 01:21:13,806
Ken!

1019
01:21:20,261 --> 01:21:21,931
The brakes.

1020
01:21:31,222 --> 01:21:37,175
This is rip out. The damned engine.
We can't use it if we can't stop.

1021
01:21:37,175 --> 01:21:40,330
The brakes would last longer
if you slowed down a bit.

1022
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:43,004
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose
of the extra power?

1023
01:21:43,775 --> 01:21:46,391
I thought the whole point was
to win the damned race.

1024
01:21:46,786 --> 01:21:52,644
Maybe we could design a new assembly.
Instead of swapping out pads in the pits,

1025
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:57,312
swap out the entire
braking system, rotors included.

1026
01:21:58,042 --> 01:21:59,354
Put in a fresh one.

1027
01:21:59,468 --> 01:22:02,506
Wait, wait. Pops.
We're allowed to do that?

1028
01:22:02,616 --> 01:22:05,406
I don't know. I don't read French.

1029
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:14,490
Brakes are a part like any other.
We are allowed to change parts.

1030
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:15,136
Yes.

1031
01:22:15,136 --> 01:22:16,418
Will we have time to do that?

1032
01:22:16,418 --> 01:22:18,367
I don't know yet, Charlie.

1033
01:22:18,674 --> 01:22:20,221
I'm gonna take him home.

1034
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:21,445
All right.

1035
01:22:21,586 --> 01:22:23,936
- Sort this shit out.
- I will.

1036
01:22:33,499 --> 01:22:35,933
Have you ever been on fire?

1037
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:41,820
No. It's never happened to me.

1038
01:22:46,759 --> 01:22:50,842
The suit's flameproof, see.
Keeps heat out.

1039
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:53,300
Yeah.

1040
01:22:54,384 --> 01:22:58,400
But Lewis Evans burnt to death
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

1041
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,512
He had a flameproof suit on.

1042
01:23:02,802 --> 01:23:04,360
Yeah, but...

1043
01:23:07,193 --> 01:23:10,469
See, he got stuck.
He couldn't breathe.

1044
01:23:11,187 --> 01:23:15,171
So as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

1045
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,574
Dad got out.

1046
01:23:21,798 --> 01:23:24,101
- He sure did.
- Peter.

1047
01:23:27,912 --> 01:23:30,584
- Bye.
- See ya.

1048
01:23:33,533 --> 01:23:35,608
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1049
01:23:36,203 --> 01:23:37,950
What's wrong with you?

1050
01:23:38,302 --> 01:23:42,165
Don't tell me brakes or...
Me and boys kicking the bucket out there.

1051
01:23:42,165 --> 01:23:44,913
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

1052
01:23:46,933 --> 01:23:48,413
It's under control.

1053
01:23:48,413 --> 01:23:49,978
What is it?

1054
01:23:49,978 --> 01:23:53,433
You know how we talked about you do your
thing, I do my thing. This is my thing.

1055
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:55,803
- Shel.
- Just trust me, Ken.

1056
01:23:56,212 --> 01:23:57,782
You got a plan?

1057
01:23:58,370 --> 01:23:59,837
Absolutely.

1058
01:24:00,188 --> 01:24:01,662
A good one?

1059
01:24:02,155 --> 01:24:03,342
It's high risk.

1060
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:06,306
- How high risk?
- Extremely high risk.

1061
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:10,097
Well, that's something.

1062
01:24:10,287 --> 01:24:12,654
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

1063
01:24:24,734 --> 01:24:27,129
Mr. Ford. This is a surprise.

1064
01:24:27,856 --> 01:24:30,393
Apologies for the
unannounced intrusion, Mr. Shelby.

1065
01:24:30,559 --> 01:24:35,652
A man pays 9 million dollars for an automobile
he ought at least be able to see it.

1066
01:24:35,652 --> 01:24:37,245
That sounds reasonable enough.

1067
01:24:37,245 --> 01:24:40,020
- Shelby, can I have a word?
- Sure.

1068
01:24:40,346 --> 01:24:41,512
In private?

1069
01:24:41,837 --> 01:24:43,615
Yeah, that would be preferable.

1070
01:24:43,615 --> 01:24:44,244
All right.

1071
01:24:44,244 --> 01:24:48,835
Phil, you wanna take care of Mr. Ford here?
Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington.

1072
01:24:48,967 --> 01:24:50,663
- Of course.
- Come to my office, Leo.

1073
01:24:50,663 --> 01:24:51,837
Pleasure, sir.

1074
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:54,324
Let me give a little tour of your car.

1075
01:24:55,063 --> 01:25:00,967
We took out 289 small block
and put in 4277 liter.

1076
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,093
Firstly, I wanna just clear the air.

1077
01:25:06,384 --> 01:25:10,586
I hope that whatever disagreements
between us can just be chopped up to

1078
01:25:11,075 --> 01:25:14,099
natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

1079
01:25:14,099 --> 01:25:16,825
I appreciate that Leo. Truly I do.

1080
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:21,823
It falls on me, Shelby,
to inform you that

1081
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,896
I have been appointed overall
Executive Director of the Racing program.

1082
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:31,032
Now, I do hope that
this won't be a problem between us.

1083
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:34,300
I assure you, Leo. It will not.

1084
01:25:44,245 --> 01:25:45,656
Hey, Carroll!

1085
01:25:46,295 --> 01:25:46,849
Carroll!

1086
01:25:46,849 --> 01:25:49,646
And what is the top speed
with the 427th?

1087
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,602
Why don't we take it for a spin?

1088
01:25:51,602 --> 01:25:52,299
What?

1089
01:25:52,299 --> 01:25:54,992
Go on, Mr. Ford.
Hope on in. Go on.

1090
01:25:54,992 --> 01:25:56,011
You want me to...

1091
01:25:56,011 --> 01:25:58,087
To see what 9 million dollars feel like.

1092
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:06,269
Open the door!

1093
01:26:06,407 --> 01:26:08,070
Hey! Open the door!

1094
01:26:08,235 --> 01:26:10,065
Open the door!

1095
01:26:12,676 --> 01:26:15,242
Just hold me right there.
And you take my hand.

1096
01:26:17,117 --> 01:26:19,821
Oh, God! I sat on my nuts.

1097
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:22,318
I'm gonna build the next one
for comfort, don't you worry.

1098
01:26:30,815 --> 01:26:32,113
Open the door.

1099
01:26:32,113 --> 01:26:33,484
Sorry sir, if you would just
give me a moment?

1100
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:34,825
Open the door!

1101
01:26:35,748 --> 01:26:36,779
You ready?

1102
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:40,131
The name in the middle of that steering wheel
should tell you that I was born ready, Shelby.

1103
01:26:40,285 --> 01:26:42,068
- Hit it.
- Attaboy.

1104
01:26:45,204 --> 01:26:46,356
Oh, that's got a little.

1105
01:26:48,018 --> 01:26:49,983
- Open the door!
- Here we go.

1106
01:26:49,983 --> 01:26:52,648
Here we go, Mr. Beebe.
Are you okay, sir?

1107
01:26:55,029 --> 01:26:56,682
Oh my God!

1108
01:26:57,844 --> 01:27:00,674
Oh my God!

1109
01:27:11,603 --> 01:27:15,825
It's about right now they uninitiated
have a tendency to soil themselves.

1110
01:28:02,039 --> 01:28:03,432
Mr. Ford.

1111
01:28:07,089 --> 01:28:08,647
Are you okay?

1112
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,755
Mr. Ford. You all right?

1113
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:16,815
I had no idea.

1114
01:28:18,869 --> 01:28:20,605
I had no idea.

1115
01:28:23,191 --> 01:28:26,751
I wish my Daddy
were alive to see this.

1116
01:28:28,425 --> 01:28:30,254
To feel this.

1117
01:28:31,474 --> 01:28:34,682
This is not a machine just anybody
can get in and easily control.

1118
01:28:34,682 --> 01:28:38,028
Absolutely not. I had no idea.

1119
01:28:38,028 --> 01:28:39,597
You wanna win Le Mans.

1120
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:43,658
You really wanna take 1st place,
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

1121
01:28:52,318 --> 01:28:53,877
Good timing.

1122
01:28:54,113 --> 01:28:56,795
He knows this car
because he helped me build it.

1123
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:02,226
Shelby, you know I've already appointed
Leo Beebe Director of

1124
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:04,698
Which is exactly
why I'm talking to you.

1125
01:29:05,483 --> 01:29:08,270
You let Ken Miles race Daytona.

1126
01:29:08,704 --> 01:29:10,098
If he wins,

1127
01:29:11,164 --> 01:29:13,097
he get to drive Le Mans.

1128
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:16,824
And if he doesn't?

1129
01:29:17,635 --> 01:29:21,122
Ford Motor Company gets full ownership
of Shelby American.

1130
01:29:21,232 --> 01:29:23,953
Lock, stock and brand. Forever.

1131
01:29:27,224 --> 01:29:29,842
<i>We're an hour of 6 at the Daytona 24.</i>

1132
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:32,608
<i>And Fords are dominating the leaderboard.</i>

1133
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:39,772
<i>Shelby American's Ken Miles holds a narrow lead over
the Holman Moody's Ford, driven by Walt Hansgen.</i>

1134
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:42,597
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

1135
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,937
This race is not just a test of our cars,
but also our teams.

1136
01:30:05,937 --> 01:30:08,070
As you know we have a second team
out there today.

1137
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,809
- Holman Moody?
- That's right.

1138
01:30:15,498 --> 01:30:17,079
Walt's pushing it too fast.

1139
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:20,693
He's pushing 7000 RPM!
Get the EZ sign out there.

1140
01:30:20,854 --> 01:30:22,643
Come on. Move! Do it now!

1141
01:30:22,643 --> 01:30:26,583
Every one of these GTs out there today
is under my direct supervision.

1142
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,610
And, of course, the supervision
of Henry Ford II.

1143
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:32,628
The drivers. The speed. The strategy.

1144
01:30:33,058 --> 01:30:35,967
Even the RPMs are determined by us.

1145
01:30:39,688 --> 01:30:44,328
<i>Ken Miles is on the furious battle with
Hansgen as the custom ground stand.</i>

1146
01:30:47,612 --> 01:30:50,993
<i>Hansgen is taking an appointment.
Miles is to return him on.</i>

1147
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:54,988
<i>Hansgen takes the lead...</i>

1148
01:31:06,149 --> 01:31:08,643
Oh, blimey! Did you see that?

1149
01:31:16,748 --> 01:31:17,990
We are racing.

1150
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:20,494
- We are still racing!
- Come on, guys! Let's go!

1151
01:31:20,494 --> 01:31:22,477
- Let's go! Move it!
- He's coming in!

1152
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,396
Let's go! Let's go, guys!
Come on!

1153
01:31:27,665 --> 01:31:29,182
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

1154
01:31:34,315 --> 01:31:36,479
Hansgen is right up our arse.

1155
01:31:36,638 --> 01:31:38,472
If I can get outta the pit
ahead of him.

1156
01:31:38,472 --> 01:31:41,219
She's running hot.
But I think she'll hold.

1157
01:31:42,633 --> 01:31:44,324
She's hot.

1158
01:31:46,031 --> 01:31:48,057
Hey, Walt. Good to see you.

1159
01:31:48,308 --> 01:31:50,932
After I get out of this pit, Shelby.
It's the last time you will.

1160
01:31:50,932 --> 01:31:53,603
Don't worry. We've got rear view mirrors.

1161
01:31:54,738 --> 01:31:56,659
What happened to that Mustang
he took out?

1162
01:31:57,024 --> 01:31:58,392
Don't know yet.

1163
01:31:58,699 --> 01:32:02,988
I can push her harder than 6, Shel.
I can feel it.

1164
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,207
How come these guys's pit
so much faster than we do?

1165
01:32:11,572 --> 01:32:14,779
We got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

1166
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,174
- No shit?
- No shit.

1167
01:32:22,447 --> 01:32:24,372
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

1168
01:32:25,883 --> 01:32:27,418
Guys, they've already left!

1169
01:32:30,173 --> 01:32:31,137
Hello?

1170
01:32:31,282 --> 01:32:33,341
That's my Mollie. Hello.

1171
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,140
Hi, luv.

1172
01:32:35,368 --> 01:32:36,930
What are you doing?

1173
01:32:37,379 --> 01:32:38,003
Just having a...

1174
01:32:38,003 --> 01:32:39,787
Mom, ask him about the brakes!

1175
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:41,303
Go to bed. It's 1 AM.

1176
01:32:41,303 --> 01:32:43,570
- Ask him.
- Go to bed! Now!

1177
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:45,689
I take it he's not asleep.

1178
01:32:45,689 --> 01:32:47,663
I'm sure he smuggled in the radio.

1179
01:32:48,985 --> 01:32:50,396
He said to ask how are the brakes.

1180
01:32:50,396 --> 01:32:54,257
The brakes. Yes.
Tell him they're working. For now.

1181
01:32:54,774 --> 01:32:57,011
Shelby's been acting very strange.

1182
01:32:57,334 --> 01:33:00,658
Ford's gonna push up
another team with a GT.

1183
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:04,836
Some sort of a yampy bloody corporate test
or something, I don't know.

1184
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:06,624
Take a rest whenever you get a chance.

1185
01:33:06,624 --> 01:33:08,081
Sorry, my luv. What you were saying?

1186
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:09,584
You've only got a few hours.

1187
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:13,362
I can't hear you very well.
I'm sorry, I can't hear ya. Wish me luck.

1188
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:15,521
- Good luck.
- I love you, darling.

1189
01:33:15,947 --> 01:33:20,712
<i>After 23 hours here at Daytona,
Walt Hansgen, driving green and white Ford</i>

1190
01:33:20,712 --> 01:33:25,127
<i>has a heavy lead
over Ken Miles and Shelby America.</i>

1191
01:33:27,745 --> 01:33:31,244
We're locked out, ain't nothing
Miles can do this late in the race.

1192
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,085
Engine's hot, we gotta keep it under 6.

1193
01:34:22,638 --> 01:34:24,602
All right.

1194
01:34:49,312 --> 01:34:51,073
She could come apart.

1195
01:34:51,229 --> 01:34:52,803
One way to find out.

1196
01:34:55,742 --> 01:34:58,376
I thought we were keeping him under 6000.

1197
01:34:58,451 --> 01:35:00,008
Shut up, Don.

1198
01:35:09,562 --> 01:35:11,836
<i>We've only minutes of racing
left here in Daytona.</i>

1199
01:35:11,836 --> 01:35:16,996
<i>Pitched battle for the win is being raced as the
number 98 Ford makes an incredible late surge.</i>

1200
01:35:16,996 --> 01:35:19,607
- What's happening?
- He's moving up.

1201
01:35:20,059 --> 01:35:22,606
<i>...Ken Miles does prepare for the win...</i>

1202
01:35:32,325 --> 01:35:34,510
White flag! Last lap!

1203
01:35:39,773 --> 01:35:42,109
Miles is pushing him. Hard.

1204
01:35:52,553 --> 01:35:54,012
That's it.

1205
01:36:04,789 --> 01:36:07,997
<i>Ken Miles drives to Walt Hansgen
coming in to the final turn.</i>

1206
01:36:39,579 --> 01:36:41,157
What the hell?

1207
01:36:48,959 --> 01:36:50,132
Come on!

1208
01:36:50,809 --> 01:36:52,628
All right.

1209
01:36:56,349 --> 01:36:58,180
Look at this now.

1210
01:37:02,905 --> 01:37:04,048
Dammit!

1211
01:37:20,909 --> 01:37:22,579
How about that?

1212
01:37:33,923 --> 01:37:34,829
Yes. Leo?

1213
01:37:34,829 --> 01:37:37,342
Mr. Ford, sir. We won.

1214
01:37:38,965 --> 01:37:41,315
We won. Ford won Daytona.

1215
01:37:43,097 --> 01:37:45,255
And which team was it, Leo?

1216
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:49,078
Shelby American. Miles driving.

1217
01:37:50,527 --> 01:37:52,231
Son of a bitch.

1218
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:57,728
Where the hell is he?
Hang on. Wait a minute.

1219
01:37:58,096 --> 01:38:00,817
Has someone lost a bulldog on the beach?

1220
01:38:01,603 --> 01:38:03,879
No. No. Come on. Come on.

1221
01:38:07,592 --> 01:38:09,546
Someone get this man a drink.

1222
01:38:28,246 --> 01:38:30,648
In bed you!
What are you doing?

1223
01:38:31,029 --> 01:38:32,815
Dirty stop out.

1224
01:38:33,246 --> 01:38:38,150
I was drawing a map,
so I could follow you on Le Mans.

1225
01:38:42,265 --> 01:38:43,816
Oh God.

1226
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:46,449
All these buttons.

1227
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:49,081
Dark pen, very accurate.

1228
01:38:50,517 --> 01:38:53,717
- Tell me about the track.
- No. I can't, Petey.

1229
01:38:54,268 --> 01:38:55,909
Please.

1230
01:39:04,099 --> 01:39:06,290
We start at the start line.

1231
01:39:07,004 --> 01:39:10,580
You actually start here, because you
have to run to your car at Le Mans.

1232
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:11,850
True enough.

1233
01:39:12,757 --> 01:39:17,022
Once your old man
manages to hobble over and pull out.

1234
01:39:17,328 --> 01:39:19,585
- And not hit anyone.
- Yes, right.

1235
01:39:21,261 --> 01:39:25,319
Accelerate, very hard up to Dunlop bridge.

1236
01:39:25,774 --> 01:39:30,223
Road braking away from you.
Then down through the trees to the Esses.

1237
01:39:30,546 --> 01:39:35,135
Accelerate up to Terte Rouge,
critical first gear corner.

1238
01:39:35,554 --> 01:39:42,304
Fast entry, keep your speed up
for your exit onto Mulsanne.

1239
01:39:42,674 --> 01:39:46,639
Long straight-away,
hemmed in by poplars. Top gear.

1240
01:39:47,095 --> 01:39:53,106
210 mph, then down to third,
revs up, ribs are your friend.

1241
01:39:53,665 --> 01:39:59,179
Get a maximum exit. Let the car run free.
Over the brow

1242
01:39:59,468 --> 01:40:06,073
then wham, the Mulsanne Corner.
Accelerate to Arnage.

1243
01:40:06,342 --> 01:40:10,016
Over the rise to the White House.
You get that right and...

1244
01:40:12,947 --> 01:40:18,117
Your first 3.5 minutes of the 24 hours.

1245
01:40:20,367 --> 01:40:24,995
You can't make every lap perfect.

1246
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:28,629
But I can try.

1247
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:37,187
All right. Off to bed you.

1248
01:40:40,352 --> 01:40:45,634
I will wake you before I leave for France.

1249
01:40:46,048 --> 01:40:47,592
I promise.

1250
01:40:47,765 --> 01:40:50,262
Okay. Goodnight.

1251
01:41:20,217 --> 01:41:22,632
Where is that? Hotel Champier?

1252
01:42:11,966 --> 01:42:14,142
It's gonna rain again tomorrow.

1253
01:42:19,192 --> 01:42:21,013
There's always rain here.

1254
01:42:23,865 --> 01:42:25,862
Start will be dry, though.

1255
01:42:27,018 --> 01:42:29,326
We'll swap back your tires come rain.

1256
01:42:31,665 --> 01:42:33,217
Yeah.

1257
01:42:36,137 --> 01:42:39,919
Might be smart to sleep, bulldog.

1258
01:42:41,748 --> 01:42:43,309
You too.

1259
01:42:44,104 --> 01:42:45,946
I'm not driving.

1260
01:42:48,425 --> 01:42:51,302
That's a bloody shame.

1261
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:54,081
Hell, I couldn't have made this team.

1262
01:42:58,708 --> 01:43:00,909
I'm gonna walk to first corner.

1263
01:43:02,526 --> 01:43:04,275
I figured.

1264
01:43:14,768 --> 01:43:16,583
Counting on it.

1265
01:43:50,443 --> 01:43:51,725
Hey, Ken.

1266
01:43:51,897 --> 01:43:53,344
Charles.

1267
01:44:07,555 --> 01:44:11,782
If this was a beauty pageant,
we just lost.

1268
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:14,402
Looks fast. Doesn't it?

1269
01:44:14,851 --> 01:44:16,815
Looks aren't everything.

1270
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:23,867
Scarfiotti and Bandini
to start for Ferrari.

1271
01:44:29,553 --> 01:44:30,587
You can take him.

1272
01:44:30,587 --> 01:44:32,906
4 minutes, Ken.
4 minutes, buddy.

1273
01:44:33,085 --> 01:44:36,053
- <i>Live from Le Mans, France.</i>
- Mom! Come on!

1274
01:44:36,595 --> 01:44:38,542
All right. I'm coming.

1275
01:44:38,854 --> 01:44:41,202
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

1276
01:44:46,111 --> 01:44:48,515
<i>Drivers, please take your places.</i>

1277
01:45:07,058 --> 01:45:10,201
- There he is.
- <i>And here they are lined up. Ready to go.</i>

1278
01:46:03,559 --> 01:46:05,004
Bloody Joseph!

1279
01:46:14,137 --> 01:46:15,477
It's all right, son.

1280
01:46:18,223 --> 01:46:20,193
You looked great out there, sir.

1281
01:46:20,843 --> 01:46:22,419
What happened to Miles?

1282
01:46:31,033 --> 01:46:32,802
Bloody hell!

1283
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:44,576
Bastard!

1284
01:47:20,299 --> 01:47:23,956
<i>After Dunlop Bandini,
Ferrari is in first place.</i>

1285
01:47:28,035 --> 01:47:29,679
Where's Miles?

1286
01:47:31,686 --> 01:47:33,907
- Where the hell is Ken?
- I don't know.

1287
01:47:42,992 --> 01:47:45,547
He's coming in.

1288
01:47:45,547 --> 01:47:48,196
Let's go! Faster! Come on!
Let's Go! Move it!

1289
01:47:48,536 --> 01:47:50,240
I think it's his door.

1290
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,409
<i>That's a rough start for the Ford team.</i>

1291
01:47:55,905 --> 01:47:58,975
The bloody door won't close!

1292
01:47:58,975 --> 01:48:01,242
- All right. All right.
- Maybe it's the heat.

1293
01:48:04,241 --> 01:48:05,097
Try that.

1294
01:48:05,097 --> 01:48:07,306
Shelby! What the hell is wrong?

1295
01:48:08,183 --> 01:48:11,223
- Something's hitting the frame.
- Oh, you're joking, aren't you?

1296
01:48:11,606 --> 01:48:13,245
Guys, get out of the way!

1297
01:48:13,391 --> 01:48:15,088
Get out of the way! Hold.

1298
01:48:16,368 --> 01:48:18,007
Go! Go! Go!

1299
01:48:26,255 --> 01:48:28,227
He's back out. Go!

1300
01:48:55,244 --> 01:48:57,823
<i>Tremendous games for Ken Miles and Ford...</i>

1301
01:48:57,823 --> 01:49:00,565
Come on dad. Come on.

1302
01:49:08,797 --> 01:49:11,341
<i>Ken Miles, Ford. A new lap record.</i>

1303
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,663
<i>3 minutes and 34 seconds.</i>

1304
01:49:29,608 --> 01:49:33,787
Shelby, he's pushing the car too hard.
That's not the plan.

1305
01:49:34,671 --> 01:49:36,235
Plan's changed.

1306
01:50:03,605 --> 01:50:06,772
Lap is 3.34. Track is 8.36.

1307
01:50:06,918 --> 01:50:09,264
Someone tell me the mph!

1308
01:50:18,203 --> 01:50:20,176
<i>3:31.9 that's a...</i>

1309
01:50:20,176 --> 01:50:21,831
Another lap record.

1310
01:50:27,422 --> 01:50:29,066
Let's go. Let's go, boys!

1311
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:32,368
- Tea is ready, Ken.
- Thank you, Chase.

1312
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:35,918
- Happy Birthday, old chap.
- Cheers, mate. Great run.

1313
01:50:45,021 --> 01:50:49,350
You're 3 seconds faster than Gurney. If you
hadn't blown the start you'd be in the lead.

1314
01:50:49,458 --> 01:50:52,168
- Can you keep this up?
- Can the car?

1315
01:50:54,572 --> 01:50:59,532
<i>There has been an incident on turn 6.
Number 18 and number 26 have collided.</i>

1316
01:51:24,688 --> 01:51:29,648
<i>It appears, Ferrari, number 20, Ludovico
Scarfiotti has also left the track.</i>

1317
01:51:39,124 --> 01:51:41,952
- All right, watch your head.
- Thank you.

1318
01:51:42,201 --> 01:51:44,207
Have a good dinner, sir.

1319
01:51:44,774 --> 01:51:46,668
McLaren's pitting.

1320
01:51:50,247 --> 01:51:52,547
Mr. Ford is probably going
somewhere nice for dinner.

1321
01:51:52,547 --> 01:51:54,460
What do you mean "probably"?

1322
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:55,784
Rain's coming.

1323
01:51:55,954 --> 01:51:57,205
All right.

1324
01:52:12,932 --> 01:52:14,437
Coming in.

1325
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:25,034
- Engine's running hot, Pops.
- All right.

1326
01:52:25,197 --> 01:52:26,726
She's hot, mate. Break on.

1327
01:52:29,736 --> 01:52:31,043
Tire.

1328
01:52:37,725 --> 01:52:40,574
- We're 220. We're okay.
- All right.

1329
01:52:44,784 --> 01:52:46,689
- Let's go.
- Swap that out.

1330
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,035
Go! Go!

1331
01:53:06,498 --> 01:53:08,080
I need a stopwatch.

1332
01:53:37,975 --> 01:53:42,330
<i>Lorenzo Bandini remains
in first place for Ferrari.</i>

1333
01:53:56,851 --> 01:54:01,158
Easy, Dan. You're getting boxed in. He's
not backing, and a full wicked that one.

1334
01:54:06,795 --> 01:54:08,538
Easy, Dan.

1335
01:54:09,957 --> 01:54:11,559
Bloody hell!

1336
01:54:12,801 --> 01:54:14,842
You arsehole!

1337
01:54:35,776 --> 01:54:37,319
You wanker!

1338
01:54:44,331 --> 01:54:47,123
Face like a sprat arse, don't ya?

1339
01:55:00,582 --> 01:55:04,811
<i>Porshe number 58 with an unidentified Ford
are run off the track.</i>

1340
01:55:16,717 --> 01:55:18,500
Nice stopwatch.

1341
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,970
You want one? They're Italian.

1342
01:55:43,827 --> 01:55:47,118
<i>Ken Miles in Ford Number 1,
and Bandini in Ferrari 21</i>

1343
01:55:47,267 --> 01:55:51,211
<i>are locked in the battle against the elements
as they push their cars to the limit.</i>

1344
01:55:51,211 --> 01:55:52,921
<i>Passed the White House corner.</i>

1345
01:56:00,986 --> 01:56:03,989
Yes, sir? Yes, sir.

1346
01:56:06,782 --> 01:56:08,470
Okay, sir.

1347
01:56:15,262 --> 01:56:16,530
Hey!

1348
01:56:18,752 --> 01:56:20,206
Give me that.

1349
01:56:22,355 --> 01:56:23,663
Dumbass.

1350
01:56:23,663 --> 01:56:25,165
Mr. Shelby.

1351
01:57:07,475 --> 01:57:09,056
Here we go.

1352
01:57:12,367 --> 01:57:14,470
Come on, girl. Come on.

1353
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:22,486
Hold it together now.

1354
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:41,695
Come on!

1355
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:46,743
<i>Leader at this moment is Ferrari Number 21,
being driven by Lorenzo Bandini.</i>

1356
01:57:46,743 --> 01:57:49,355
His brakes are shot.
All right. Here we go.

1357
01:57:49,474 --> 01:57:53,995
<i>It looks like Ken Miles is bringing the
Number 1 Ford into the pits very slowly.</i>

1358
01:57:57,523 --> 01:58:00,159
Brakes! Nothing! Gone!

1359
01:58:00,463 --> 01:58:02,368
All right. Let's go! Let's Go!

1360
01:58:03,957 --> 01:58:06,728
I had him! I almost had him!

1361
01:58:08,573 --> 01:58:10,996
He's putting another lap on us now.

1362
01:58:14,798 --> 01:58:16,545
Now! Now! Faster!

1363
01:58:20,679 --> 01:58:22,679
They're doing it! The brakes!

1364
01:58:25,513 --> 01:58:27,311
Faster! Faster!

1365
01:58:46,404 --> 01:58:49,261
Against the rules.
You can't just change things.

1366
01:58:49,261 --> 01:58:50,266
No. No. No.

1367
01:58:50,266 --> 01:58:52,118
You show me where it says in your book

1368
01:58:52,118 --> 01:58:56,483
that we cannot swap out the system
and then you can disqualify us.

1369
01:58:56,483 --> 01:58:58,395
- This is not legal.
- Calm down. Calm down.

1370
01:58:58,395 --> 01:58:59,228
This is not legal.

1371
01:58:59,228 --> 01:59:03,958
You show me where it says in that little rule
book where I can't swap out my upright assembly.

1372
01:59:03,958 --> 01:59:05,073
A part is a part.

1373
01:59:05,073 --> 01:59:10,012
Be it a brake caliper or a rotor or an upright
assembly and I can swap out any damn thing I want to.

1374
01:59:10,182 --> 01:59:11,942
We read your damn rule book.

1375
01:59:17,757 --> 01:59:20,089
Bandini's pitting! He's pitting!

1376
01:59:27,406 --> 01:59:30,135
What a shame. I think he blew the line.

1377
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:32,294
He was trying to keep up with you.

1378
01:59:41,793 --> 01:59:44,146
I don't speak Italian, but he ain't happy.

1379
01:59:55,411 --> 01:59:57,991
Get me out of here, Pops.
Come on!

1380
01:59:59,023 --> 02:00:00,556
Almost set, Ken.

1381
02:00:06,203 --> 02:00:08,366
You can still take him,
but you gotta pass him twice.

1382
02:00:08,366 --> 02:00:10,500
I got it. Pass him twice.

1383
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:22,835
<i>Ford Number 1, driven by Ken Miles is back on.
Hot on the heels of Bandini in Ferrari 21.</i>

1384
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:23,855
Not bloody got it off me, are you?
Comes on!

1385
02:01:24,492 --> 02:01:26,288
He's off his pace.

1386
02:01:27,513 --> 02:01:29,550
He doesn't trust the car yet.

1387
02:01:29,952 --> 02:01:32,829
Come on, Ken.
I gave you the new brakes, buddy.

1388
02:01:38,817 --> 02:01:40,366
All right.

1389
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:43,455
What'd you come here for?

1390
02:01:45,807 --> 02:01:47,634
Let's do it.

1391
02:02:11,567 --> 02:02:13,435
See? Come on!

1392
02:02:24,543 --> 02:02:26,266
He ain't done it yet.

1393
02:02:29,692 --> 02:02:31,762
He needs to take another lap on him.

1394
02:02:55,367 --> 02:02:59,396
- He needs to pit soon.
- He needs to catch Bandini first.

1395
02:03:09,854 --> 02:03:11,459
All right, you bastard.

1396
02:03:12,635 --> 02:03:14,231
Let's do this again.

1397
02:03:43,623 --> 02:03:44,786
Come on, girl.

1398
02:03:45,329 --> 02:03:47,890
That's my girl! That's my girl!

1399
02:04:07,531 --> 02:04:10,277
Oh my God!

1400
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:12,544
Bloody hell!

1401
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,325
He did it. We're in the lead.

1402
02:04:28,650 --> 02:04:30,023
Are we in the lead?

1403
02:04:30,137 --> 02:04:31,870
What about Bandini?

1404
02:04:32,605 --> 02:04:34,218
Where's Bandini?

1405
02:04:34,621 --> 02:04:38,172
He's done. Finished. Ferrari's over.

1406
02:04:38,172 --> 02:04:40,300
McLaren's 4 minutes behind him in a GT.

1407
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:44,191
Should we line them: Ken first,
and 2 and 3. All Fords.

1408
02:05:06,006 --> 02:05:07,731
The Deuce is coming.

1409
02:05:16,406 --> 02:05:19,417
Ken's up in a half an hour.
Do you want me to wake him?

1410
02:05:19,417 --> 02:05:21,181
No, let him sleep.

1411
02:05:22,493 --> 02:05:24,330
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

1412
02:05:24,614 --> 02:05:26,569
- Good job.
- Not quite there yet, but...

1413
02:05:27,938 --> 02:05:29,615
There he is.

1414
02:05:31,475 --> 02:05:33,160
Brief me, Leo.

1415
02:05:33,430 --> 02:05:35,781
We're running one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

1416
02:05:36,647 --> 02:05:39,077
- Who's in the lead?
- Him. Miles.

1417
02:05:41,922 --> 02:05:43,982
I was thinking, Mr. Ford.

1418
02:05:44,409 --> 02:05:50,519
Wouldn't it be great if all 3 Fords lined up
across the finish line the exact same time?

1419
02:05:50,733 --> 02:05:52,814
They'll line up and came home together.

1420
02:05:52,814 --> 02:05:55,484
Ford. Ford. Ford.

1421
02:05:55,941 --> 02:05:58,027
I don't think we can actually do that, sir.

1422
02:05:59,226 --> 02:06:00,639
Why not?

1423
02:06:01,322 --> 02:06:06,361
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.
What would you have him to, slow down?

1424
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:09,420
Yeah.

1425
02:06:21,016 --> 02:06:25,147
He thinks it would be a historic moment for
Ford, it'll make him a great photograph.

1426
02:06:26,324 --> 02:06:28,827
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here.

1427
02:06:29,158 --> 02:06:30,327
And so do you.

1428
02:06:30,445 --> 02:06:32,321
Are you gonna tell him or
do you need me to?

1429
02:06:33,877 --> 02:06:36,366
Don't go near my driver. Go on.

1430
02:06:37,336 --> 02:06:39,918
- This is what Mr. Ford wants.
- Go on now.

1431
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:42,580
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

1432
02:06:59,457 --> 02:07:03,053
Guys. Stan, come on.
Let's go.

1433
02:07:06,956 --> 02:07:08,334
What'd Beebe want?

1434
02:07:14,289 --> 02:07:15,969
It's off the scale, isn't it?

1435
02:07:21,402 --> 02:07:23,536
They want you to slow down.

1436
02:07:27,304 --> 02:07:29,180
Run that part to me again.

1437
02:07:29,429 --> 02:07:31,414
They want you to slow down.

1438
02:07:33,909 --> 02:07:36,998
You're outshining the car, Ken.
You're 4 minutes up on McLaren.

1439
02:07:36,998 --> 02:07:41,511
The Deuce wants the 3 Fords across the
finish line: 1, 2, 3, all together.

1440
02:07:46,643 --> 02:07:49,621
They're asking that you be a team player.

1441
02:07:50,404 --> 02:07:52,277
To make that photograph happen.

1442
02:07:52,277 --> 02:07:55,967
A photograph. That's good.

1443
02:07:55,967 --> 02:07:58,467
That is good!

1444
02:08:00,606 --> 02:08:05,593
Ken, even if you tie for first,
you'll still be first man ever to win

1445
02:08:05,824 --> 02:08:08,753
Sebring, Daytona, Le Mans at the same year.

1446
02:08:09,243 --> 02:08:11,356
You'll have the triple crown.

1447
02:08:20,941 --> 02:08:23,861
I am unable to get you
to follow an order since day one.

1448
02:08:24,219 --> 02:08:26,584
Whatever you wanna do
is fine with me.

1449
02:08:27,917 --> 02:08:29,704
My choice?

1450
02:08:30,792 --> 02:08:32,554
Your choice.

1451
02:08:38,739 --> 02:08:42,394
Engine's running at boiling.
The brakes are shot.

1452
02:08:45,463 --> 02:08:46,952
How was that?

1453
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:49,359
Taken care of.

1454
02:08:49,544 --> 02:08:53,052
The car is yours, Ken.
Ken, the car is yours.

1455
02:08:54,677 --> 02:08:56,700
Car is yours, Ken.

1456
02:09:29,530 --> 02:09:33,079
<i>It's the Fords that have the cars
to be blaming the top 3 positions.</i>

1457
02:09:33,079 --> 02:09:34,855
What the hell is he doing?

1458
02:09:39,754 --> 02:09:42,442
Don't answer that!
Get away from it!

1459
02:09:42,591 --> 02:09:44,205
Get away from it!

1460
02:10:10,887 --> 02:10:13,609
- He's gonna break his own record.
- Shut up!

1461
02:10:22,571 --> 02:10:24,215
Wait for it.

1462
02:10:25,836 --> 02:10:27,273
Wait for it.

1463
02:10:30,271 --> 02:10:31,395
Now.

1464
02:10:37,158 --> 02:10:39,730
Miles!

1465
02:11:15,101 --> 02:11:16,858
Benissimo.

1466
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:20,494
3:30.6.
That's another record.

1467
02:11:26,161 --> 02:11:28,381
That's a perfect lap.

1468
02:11:28,381 --> 02:11:33,790
<i>And virtually guaranteeing the 1st place for
Shelby American and their exciting GT Ford.</i>

1469
02:11:33,873 --> 02:11:41,092
<i>Ken Miles and Shelby American's Ford Number
1 just beat his own lap record, 3:30.6.</i>

1470
02:11:41,092 --> 02:11:44,084
Bring him in! Right now!
He's outta control!

1471
02:11:44,532 --> 02:11:47,615
Bring him in before he wrecks that car
and we don't finish!

1472
02:11:49,810 --> 02:11:51,166
Bring him in, Shelby!

1473
02:11:51,319 --> 02:11:54,483
Or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

1474
02:11:55,943 --> 02:12:00,157
Ken Miles is behind the wheel, Leo.
That's his car to the finish.

1475
02:13:35,229 --> 02:13:37,470
Come on, lads. Where are you?

1476
02:13:48,167 --> 02:13:49,824
What's he doing?

1477
02:13:50,403 --> 02:13:52,714
Mom, why is he slowing down?

1478
02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:26,780
The 3 Fords are going to
cross the line together.

1479
02:14:27,044 --> 02:14:29,212
Ken Miles slowed down.
He waited for them.

1480
02:14:29,446 --> 02:14:31,972
Dad? No.

1481
02:14:32,107 --> 02:14:33,039
- It's all right.
- Dad.

1482
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:35,440
It's all right. He's bringing them in.

1483
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:36,501
<i>...Lead by Ken Miles...</i>

1484
02:14:36,501 --> 02:14:39,463
- He's bringing them all in together.
- <i>He's certainly the leader of this group.</i>

1485
02:14:40,420 --> 02:14:42,059
Good for you.

1486
02:14:42,692 --> 02:14:44,427
Good for you, Ken.

1487
02:15:11,698 --> 02:15:13,462
Look at that!

1488
02:15:15,215 --> 02:15:16,812
Well done, Leo.

1489
02:15:37,129 --> 02:15:40,414
Explain to me how he's finished first
if he's not won the race?

1490
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:44,520
Because McLaren started from further,
so he came into and he won.

1491
02:15:44,579 --> 02:15:46,080
It's not a tie!

1492
02:15:46,406 --> 02:15:51,455
Because McLaren started further back, they're saying. He's
traveled a little bit further. So, he's won and not Ken.

1493
02:15:51,455 --> 02:15:53,233
That's bullshit!

1494
02:15:53,373 --> 02:15:55,351
Shel! Hold on!

1495
02:16:09,394 --> 02:16:12,194
Where is the tie?
Where is the goddamn tie?

1496
02:16:12,318 --> 02:16:13,289
What?

1497
02:16:13,539 --> 02:16:14,438
You son of a bitch!

1498
02:16:15,051 --> 02:16:16,403
- You knew!
- I didn't, I swear.

1499
02:16:16,403 --> 02:16:17,901
Enough!

1500
02:16:20,419 --> 02:16:22,672
Nice race, mate. Cograts.

1501
02:16:44,401 --> 02:16:46,093
Shel!

1502
02:16:50,037 --> 02:16:51,736
They robbed you, Ken.

1503
02:16:51,736 --> 02:16:56,064
<i>Here's the clarification. Both the
drivers finished the race in a heat.</i>

1504
02:16:56,198 --> 02:16:59,670
<i>McLaren has been ruled the winner
as he started from further back.</i>

1505
02:16:59,670 --> 02:17:02,198
Some bullshit technicality.

1506
02:17:15,366 --> 02:17:17,407
I never should've asked you.

1507
02:17:23,026 --> 02:17:25,177
Selling ties, yeah?

1508
02:17:27,457 --> 02:17:29,213
That's what they do.

1509
02:17:31,266 --> 02:17:33,739
You promised me the drive,

1510
02:17:35,878 --> 02:17:37,842
not the win.

1511
02:17:38,342 --> 02:17:40,441
It was a hell of a drive.

1512
02:17:40,967 --> 02:17:42,895
She's a hell of a machine.

1513
02:17:43,353 --> 02:17:45,047
She's fast.

1514
02:17:46,482 --> 02:17:48,254
Could be faster.

1515
02:17:49,799 --> 02:17:52,371
The 7 liters sweet.

1516
02:17:54,132 --> 02:17:59,637
We still need a lighter chassis.
I was thinking bonded aluminum.

1517
02:17:59,733 --> 02:18:05,591
It's a ground up rebuild, but if it works
we can lose a couple of hundred pounds.

1518
02:18:05,739 --> 02:18:07,757
What the hell are we doing here?

1519
02:18:09,081 --> 02:18:11,481
Let me take the shower,
get a cup of tea.

1520
02:18:11,630 --> 02:18:13,388
Have a sandwich or something.

1521
02:18:14,010 --> 02:18:16,408
We gonna get the bastards the next year.

1522
02:18:40,241 --> 02:18:42,801
Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.

1523
02:18:43,754 --> 02:18:47,716
What do you think of those honeycomb
panels. What you were looking for?

1524
02:18:47,716 --> 02:18:50,093
I don't know yet.

1525
02:19:14,467 --> 02:19:16,907
She looks pretty good.

1526
02:19:26,548 --> 02:19:30,304
There's a point at 7000 RPM

1527
02:19:31,425 --> 02:19:34,040
where everything fades.

1528
02:19:36,031 --> 02:19:41,105
The machine becomes weightless.
Just disappears.

1529
02:19:42,523 --> 02:19:47,598
And all that left is a body
moving through space and time.

1530
02:19:50,355 --> 02:19:55,583
7000 RPM, that's where you meet it.

1531
02:19:56,991 --> 02:20:01,759
You feel it coming.
It creeps up on you, close in your ear,

1532
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:14,099
and asks you a question.
The only question that matters.

1533
02:20:22,157 --> 02:20:24,316
"Who are you"?

1534
02:20:57,450 --> 02:20:58,541
What do you think?

1535
02:20:58,541 --> 02:21:03,177
It's fantastic!
That was really good. Nice and smooth.

1536
02:21:04,145 --> 02:21:06,405
No vibration in the box.
She's really strong.

1537
02:21:06,405 --> 02:21:10,970
You drove her for less than an hour.
You can't tell shit after an hour.

1538
02:21:14,262 --> 02:21:16,195
Hey, Shel.

1539
02:21:25,562 --> 02:21:31,142
Hey, Shell. That guy, the one in the hat.
He's ready to close on those two 427's.

1540
02:21:31,215 --> 02:21:37,236
His and hers. Full freight.
They flew in from Galveston.

1541
02:21:41,018 --> 02:21:44,142
I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

1542
02:21:44,598 --> 02:21:46,407
And do what?

1543
02:21:47,701 --> 02:21:49,712
Be Carroll Shelby.

1544
02:21:50,222 --> 02:21:53,082
Tell them a story.
Spin a few magic words.

1545
02:21:53,474 --> 02:21:56,492
What does that mean? Magic words?

1546
02:21:57,468 --> 02:22:03,189
It means, come outside, and say hello, and
make them feel good about their purchase.

1547
02:22:03,189 --> 02:22:06,665
They're getting the damn cars.
That's what they get for their money, Phil.

1548
02:22:06,791 --> 02:22:09,761
Either they want them or they don't.
Am I some kind of a lounge act?!

1549
02:22:09,877 --> 02:22:12,545
Am I here to talk people into things?!

1550
02:22:23,351 --> 02:22:25,849
It's been 6 months, Shel.

1551
02:22:26,666 --> 02:22:28,748
Six months.

1552
02:22:32,731 --> 02:22:35,578
Sometimes, they don't get
out of the car.

1553
02:23:10,405 --> 02:23:12,252
Peter!

1554
02:23:12,705 --> 02:23:15,288
Peter, come and take the garbage out!

1555
02:23:15,288 --> 02:23:17,452
Mr. Shelby?

1556
02:23:18,452 --> 02:23:20,020
Hello, Pete.

1557
02:23:21,693 --> 02:23:23,749
I remember that wrench.

1558
02:23:24,481 --> 02:23:26,302
My Dad threw it at you.

1559
02:23:27,571 --> 02:23:29,336
I believe he did.

1560
02:23:29,771 --> 02:23:31,062
Why?

1561
02:23:35,905 --> 02:23:38,375
I think I probably
said something to him.

1562
02:23:39,014 --> 02:23:40,797
Called him a few names.

1563
02:23:42,559 --> 02:23:44,373
That's right.

1564
02:23:52,841 --> 02:23:55,016
Do you wanna speak to my Mom?

1565
02:23:55,141 --> 02:24:00,417
I did. I came to say hello
and check in on her.

1566
02:24:04,899 --> 02:24:07,697
Then, I started thinking that sometimes

1567
02:24:09,494 --> 02:24:16,416
the words just are not useful.

1568
02:24:22,125 --> 02:24:26,952
Tools are useful 'cause you can make stuff
with 'em, and you can fix stuff with 'em.

1569
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:29,243
Here.

1570
02:24:30,179 --> 02:24:31,840
Thanks.

1571
02:24:39,973 --> 02:24:42,477
Your Daddy was a...

1572
02:24:45,134 --> 02:24:47,593
He was your friend.

1573
02:24:53,011 --> 02:24:54,935
Yes, he was.

1574
02:24:55,699 --> 02:24:57,441
Yes, sir.

1575
02:25:02,230 --> 02:25:05,665
And he thought
you were just finer than frog fur.

1576
02:25:09,552 --> 02:25:11,268
Peter!

1577
02:25:16,337 --> 02:25:18,805
I think I've gotta go help my Mom.

1578
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:23,506
What are you doing here then? Go on.

1579
02:25:23,862 --> 02:25:25,946
Bye.

1580
