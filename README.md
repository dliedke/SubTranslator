# SubTranslator

Automatically translate srt subtitles using Chrome and Selenium.

Better than some sites that translate the page because the translation quality is lost.

This takes more time but the translation quality is much better.

Set language code in variable 'translatedLanguage' in Main() method. 

Then send the srt filename as parameter in command line when calling the compiled application.
