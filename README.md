# SubTranslator

Automatically translate srt subtitles using Chrome and Selenium. Better than some sites that translate the page because the translation quality is lost. This takes more time but the translation quality is much better.

Download Chrome Driver from http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html and place it in the same directory as executable file.

Set language code in variable 'translatedLanguage' in Main() method and send the srt file name as parameter in command line when calling the compiled application.
